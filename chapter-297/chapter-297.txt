Sigh. Hoo.

Choi Min-Woo exhaled deeply, his breath mingling with the ambient Qi.

As he inhaled, he consciously absorbed the Qi saturating the air, simultaneously stirring the dormant cluster of Qi in his lower abdomen.

'Mana.'

It was the power bestowed upon the awakened, a formidable weapon against monsters.

Yet, his mentor, Jin Tae-Kyung, who had taught him the Jin Family's Cultivation Technique, referred to it differently.

'Qi.'

The more Choi Min-Woo observed Jin Tae-Kyung, the more enigmatic he seemed.

Undertaking and accomplishing feats others wouldn't dare dream of, his teachings were far from ordinary.

Dantian, Qi, Qi circulation, Jin Family's Cultivation Technique...

Each new revelation about him was astonishing, yet now, it was bewildering.

'To impart the Mana Cultivation Technique so casually...'

Choi Min-Woo understood the sheer power of the Jin Family's Cultivation Technique.

It was evident not only to hunters but to any perceptive individual.

If a hunter is a sword, then Jin Family's Cultivation Technique is a whetstone.

It could sharpen even the bluntest blade.

Given its effectiveness and rarity, its worth was immeasurable.

'Such generosity to divulge such a profound secret, the prowess to vanquish named monsters solo, the courage to confront Lee Jeong-Ryong and the Ares Guild... Is there anyone else like him?'

Each day, Choi Min-Woo's realization of Jin Tae-Kyung's extraordinariness deepened, as did his gratitude for being under Jin Tae-Kyung's tutelage.

'I must not fail to meet his expectations.'

This resolve fueled Choi Min-Woo to practice the Jin Family's Technique relentlessly, even in his sleep.

And now, the results were palpable.

Swoosh.

He was so engrossed in practicing the Qi circulation technique that time became irrelevant.

A powerful energy surged through his meridians, growing incrementally. A week ago, he hadn't even been aware of such energy.

Suddenly, a conversation he had with Jin Tae-Kyung that day flashed through Choi Min-Woo's mind.

'Hey, Team Leader.'

'Yes?'

'Did you ever consume something good when you were young? Like ginseng, or some round elixir?'

'Not at all. My meals have always been organic, but I've never eaten anything special.'

'I bet you've never even caught a common cold from childhood until now. Right?'

'That's correct. How did you know?'

'Your physical condition, it's... No, your body has always been remarkable.'

'Is that so? But any hunter would naturally have a good physique.'

'It's not merely because you're a hunter; it's fundamentally due to your extraordinary constitution. I suspect your grandfather may have played a role in this.'

'My grandfather...?'

'Yes. Does anything come to mind?'

'I'm not sure. I was too young to remember clearly. According to Butler Kim, he visited me occasionally... but that's it.'

'Hmm. Personally, I think that's the only answer.'

Choi Min-Woo's thoughts drifted to his grandfather. Had he last seen him before starting elementary school?

His memory of his grandfather's face was hazy, contrasting with the clarity of the photographs online. Their relationship, much like their physical proximity in those pictures, seemed distant.

'Could such immense energy within me be my grandfather's doing?'

This revelation about his grandfather set Choi Min-Woo's heart racing.

As if responding to his feelings, the energy coursing through him vibrated.

The tremendous amount of energy that Jin Tae-Kyung referred to as a 'Gapja' made one final, majestic revolution before settling calmly in his dantian, below his navel.

With a tingling sense of elation, Choi Min-Woo's eyes fluttered open.

"Hoo."

His prolonged breath held traces of the Qi cultivation technique.

Unbeknownst to Choi, he had achieved 4th level mastery of the Jin Family's Cultivation Technique in an astonishingly short period of a week.

For someone with Choi Min-Woo's immense Qi and remarkable constitution, which even Jin Tae-Kyung acknowledged, such rapid progress was possible.

'The others haven't reached this point yet.'

Surveying the room, Choi Min-Woo noted the three individuals deeply engrossed in their Qi cultivation.

Butler Kim, Song Song, and Mr. Rough Guy sat spaced apart, each absorbed in their practice.

Their learning of the Jin Family's Cultivation Technique was a closely guarded secret.

They were in Choi Min-Woo's private training room, heavily secured and isolated.

'I shouldn't disturb them.'

Remembering Jin Tae-Kyung's warnings about the perilous 'Qi Deviation,' Choi Min-Woo treaded lightly as he exited.

Outside, he reactivated his phone, which had been off for some time. Within moments, his jaw dropped in astonishment.

The screen lit up with a flurry of internet news updates, each more startling than the last.

\- Urgent News: Named Monster Reappears! South Korea Faces Crisis!

\- Unforeseen Complications at the A-rank Gate, \[Black Forest of the Necromancer\].

\- Jin Tae-Kyung's Heroic Act: Volunteers as Bait. Eyewitness Accounts Praise His Noble Sacrifice.

\- Hunter Association Mobilizes: Formulating Countermeasures, Assembling Rescue Teams.

\- Peace Guild in Disarray: Leadership Unreachable.

\- Public Outcry Grows Over Association's Delayed Response. Jin Tae-Kyung Alone for Over 20 Minutes.

\- Hope for a Miracle?

"Wait, what is this?"

What do they mean by sacrifice, and what about being alone?

Jin Tae-Kyung, who should be patrolling the gate with his guild members, is now being talked about as a sacrifice.

And now, a Named Monster had emerged!

Choi Min-Woo's initial shock quickly gave way to focused determination.

'This isn't the time for shock.'

He knew Jin Tae-Kyung's strength well enough.

Yet, if Jin Tae-Kyung had chosen to act as bait, allowing his guild to retreat, he must be facing an extraordinary peril.

'This is... really dangerous.'

His grip on the phone tightened just as the training room door swung open, revealing three figures.

"Ah, that feels refreshing."

"Mister, don't you think my skin looks better?"

"Ah, Young Master. You were already here..."

"Butler Kim!"

The urgency in Choi Min-Woo's voice instantly alerted the others to the gravity of the situation.

Butler Kim's voice remained calm.

"What's happened?"

"We need to go to Jin Tae-Kyung, right now!"

\*\*\*

The scene at the entrance of the A-rank Gate, \[Black Forest of the Necromancer\], was chaotic.

Hunters from the Association and various guilds had gathered for safety measures, alongside reporters daring enough to seek exclusive stories.

The air was thick with murmurs and whispers from the crowd.

"Is Jin Tae-Kyung dead?"

"It's grim. It's been silent for over an hour now."

"But didn't Jin Tae-Kyung already defeat a Named Monster once?"

"Ah, that Wyvern, right? Impressive indeed, but..."

While conversing with a junior reporter, the senior reporter flicked ash off his cigarette.

"Think about it, you're a Hunter section reporter. Didn't you hear the interview with the Peace Guild member who was with Jin Tae-Kyung? It wasn't just one Named Monster; there were hundreds more. It's a different case."

"Is it that serious?"

"Absolutely. We're only holding on because it's Jin Tae-Kyung out there. With anyone else, there wouldn’t even be a sliver of hope. This isn’t a rescue mission in the making. It’s more likely a recovery operation."

The junior reporter let out a subdued sigh.

"That's a tough situation."

"We're crazy to be here writing articles amidst this. Totally messed up."

"But we're allowed to report since it's somewhat secure, right?"

"See over there? More than a dozen A-rank hunters have come."

The senior reporter gestured towards a group of formidable-looking hunters.

Among them, the ones with crossed sword and shield emblems on their chests stood out.

"Ares Guild sent reinforcements too."

"They've just come in. They rarely heed government calls unless there's something in it for them... I wonder what drew them here."

"Did they come to rescue Jin Tae-Kyung?"

"Maybe. Or maybe they're after the Named Monster."

Named Monsters were treasures of immense value.

'One-Eyed Carus,' the recent one vanquished by Jin Tae-Kyung, was in its early stages of awakening but had already been worth billions.

"But... with this much force, can't they start the rescue operation now? We have enough power."

"Sure, we have enough. But they might be thinking differently."

"How so?"

"Never mind. Forget it."

The senior reporter abruptly ended the conversation.

A veteran of nearly two decades in journalism, he had a wide network and extensive experience. He had seen and heard more than most.

'Jin Tae-Kyung must have become a thorn in their side.'

Recently, he had stumbled upon intriguing information from a reliable source.

There was an unusual undercurrent between the Myeongdong and Peace Guilds.

It was a whisper in the wind, yet his journalistic instincts sensed an unfolding narrative.

'The appearance of the Ares Guild too.'

The presence of the Ares Guild was noteworthy but not unexpected, given the situation involving a Named Monster.

Yet, there was an air of unease, a feeling the reporter couldn't quite place.

His gaze shifted towards the group of leaders, his brow furrowing.

'Their palms will get worn out at this rate.'

The head of the Seoul branch of the Association, effectively in charge of the situation, was seen eagerly rubbing his hands while speaking to a man in his thirties.

'What was that guy's name? Seok Gosa… Seok Go-Jun?'

Recognized as the security team leader of the Ares Guild, Seok Go-Jun was practically Lee Jeong-Ryong's right-hand man.

The sight of the Seoul branch head pandering to him hinted at why the rescue team’s deployment was being delayed.

"These guys, always finding a way to have their fun."

The senior reporter muttered under his breath, extinguishing his half-smoked cigarette.

"It's the Peace Guild!"

"What? Where!"

"Hey, hey! Get the camera ready!"

Amidst the rising commotion and the media crew's shouts, all eyes turned in unison.

A group of four, three men and one woman, moved through the crowd with an air of purpose.

They reached the gate, only to be stopped by the Seoul branch hunters.

"Please step aside."

Choi Min-Woo's voice was calm but carried an unmistakable authority. The head of the Seoul branch approached hastily.

"It's not yet confirmed to be safe. We need more time to initiate the rescue operation..."

"Time? Are you still talking about time here?"

"Just a moment, just a brief moment is enough."

"Nearly an hour has already passed."

Choi Min-Woo's tone remained steady, but his eyes blazed with a fiery urgency, mirrored by his companions.

"We must begin the rescue now."

"Not now. Follow the policy."

"Whose policy? The Association's? Or..."

In an instant, Choi Min-Woo's gaze swept past the Association head, landing on Seok Go-Jun.

He bit his lip, frustration evident, then continued resolutely.

"Send the Association hunters away. If necessary, our Peace Guild alone will enter."

"Do you not realize that this goes against the regulations?"

The chairman of the Seoul branch replied in an authoritative tone, snapping his fingers. Hunters from the Seoul branch swiftly surrounded the Peace Guild members, their expressions a mix of disapproval and wariness.

"It won't take too long. Have patience and wait."

At these words, Choi Min-Woo's restraint shattered. His voice, fierce and full of desperation, echoed across the area.

"My friend is in there!"

Click, flash!

Cameras snapped furiously, capturing this intense moment, but Choi Min-Woo's impassioned plea continued unabated, his rage palpable.

"He could die! He must be saved!"

Images of Jin Tae-Kyung, battling alone against the Named Monster and its skeletal horde, ignited a seething volcano of fury within him.

"Move aside, you bastards!"

\*\*\*

The Skeleton Warlord spoke with a commanding voice.

\- In the name of the commander, arise. My faithful subordinates, the strong soldiers of the legion!

Suddenly, someone struck the Warlord's skull with a lightning-quick movement.

Thump!

"Damn it, really. Why are your spells so unnecessarily long? I told you to make it quick."

"..."

"Aren't you going to answer?"

\- ...Yes.

The Warlord's voice carried a tone of reluctant acquiescence.

\- Fine, fine. Skeletons, arise...

Whoosh!

A surge of magical energy erupted from the Warlord, blanketing The Black Forest.

The young man, witnessing the rapid emergence of skeletons from the earth, wore a bright, almost gleeful smile.

"Ah, looks like this year's harvest will be bountiful."
