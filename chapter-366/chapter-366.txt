Drip, drip-drip-drip.

The world was submerged in a darkness so profound that time seemed immeasurable.

Dark clouds crowded the sky, and a relentless rain poured down from the heavens.

Pools of blood overflowed on the Tang Family of Sichuan's grounds, and corpses were piled into small mounds.

“So, what’s the situation inside?”

At the entrance to the Tang Family of Sichuan, a figure in black inquired as he sat on the corpse of a fallen martial artist.

“The conflict is ongoing. About a hundred people remain.”

“What? That many?”

“Only half of them are martial artists. The rest are craftsmen, women, or children who have not learned martial arts.”

"Then, eliminating them should be straightforward. Why the delay?"

The figure in black showed evident displeasure, frustrated by the prolonged duty of guarding the entrance while others collected their merits.

“Well, that is…”

“Is there a complication?”

The subordinate hurriedly continued, seeing his superior’s furrowed brows.

“Some of the remaining martial artists of the Tang Family are elites, but the operation is delayed because they activated their hidden traps.”

“Hidden traps? It should not be difficult to destroy if it’s poison.”

“It’s not poison, but explosives. They were hiding the Heaven-Shaking Thunder.” \[Note: this is the same thing that the Blood Lord used to lure Hong Dao away from the Grand Celestial Banquet.\]

“…You can’t mean the Heaven-Shaking Thunder from the Thunderbolt Sect that I know of.” \[Note: I am uncertain if this means the "Thunderbolt Sect" or the "Thunderbolt Family". However, I am more confident that this is a Sect, because it is unlikely that Thunderbolt is some family's last name (although this would be a kick-ass last name. Imagine naming your kid Hurricane with this last name). But in any case, it is not a current living faction in Murim, as we will find out soon enough.\]

“It appears so. Our forces sustained significant losses due to the unexpected deployment of the Heaven-Shaking Thunder."

“What madness is this.”

Astonishment was clear on the black-clothed figure’s face. The unexpected loud noise had hinted at trouble, but the presence of the legendary Heaven-Shaking Thunder, presumed lost with the demise of the Thunderbolt Sect, was shocking.

Victory's delay seemed understandable now.

“Wait, then what has the Western Heavenly Demon Lord been doing? He could have slaughtered them all by now.”

The query conveyed unwavering confidence in the Western Heavenly Demon Lord.

As the Western Heavenly Demon Lord was one of the few beings capable of understanding the Almighty Heavenly Lord's commands and wielded immense divine power, unwavering confidence was warranted.

Not even the incredibly powerful Heaven-Shaking Thunder could harm the Western Heavenly Demon Lord.

"I’ve been informed that he ventured into the Tang Family’s underground prison about an hour ago."

Understanding dawned on the black-clothed figure upon hearing the subordinate’s report.

If the Western Heavenly Demon Lord had intervened personally, there was undoubtedly a valid reason. The situation would be resolved flawlessly. There was neither cause for concern nor doubt.

This sentiment was shared not only by the figure in black but also by all who were present.

"Then, what about the First Monster?"

The First Monster, the eldest of the Monstrous Trio of Qilian serving under the Western Heavenly Demon Lord, was renowned for his strength.

The subordinate paused briefly before responding.

"He's currently locked in a fierce battle with the Sword Saint's heir in the inner courtyard. After one of our own was decapitated while reporting on the Heaven-Shaking Thunder, no one has dared to approach."

"…I see."

The figure in black kept his response succinct.

While admiration and trust were reserved for the Western Heavenly Demon Lord, the First Monster inspired fear. The risk of meeting a grisly fate for careless words was too great.

"Um, Unit Leader?"

"Do you have something to say?"

"Yes, the Unit Vice Leader asked about the news from the brothers who went to Qingcheng and Emei."

"A letter arrived just before you did."

Upon receiving a slender container from the figure in black, the subordinate examined it with a puzzled look.

"This is…"

"It's from Emei."

"Is this the only one?"

"Yes. We haven’t heard anything from Qingcheng yet."

"He has surpassed the agreed upon time."

"That's true. But you know what kind of people the other Unit Leaders are."

The Monstrous Trio of Qilian were notorious not just for their fearsome appearance.

Each was known for their cruelty and unpredictable wrath, easily provoked by the sight of blood.

Yet, the Third Monster, overseeing Emei, proved somewhat more reliable, having dispatched the report punctually.

The situation in Emei, as detailed in the correspondence, was far from favorable.

'The Beggar Sect has intervened.'

Unexpectedly, swordsmen armed with sticks and the iconic dog-beating staffs of the Beggar Sect had made an appearance.

Although individually their martial prowess may not match that of Dark Heaven's martial artists, the implications were profound.

'They've caught the scent already.'

The assault, planned to be swift and decisive, was now dragged out by these unforeseen elements. Nevertheless, the man in black maintained confidence in their ultimate victory.

Dismissing a momentary unease, his attention was abruptly drawn elsewhere.

"Hmm?"

"What is it?"

"What is that?"

Confusion laced the voice of the figure in black as the subordinate, along with around thirty martial artists stationed across the ramparts, converged around their Unit Leader.

Shortly thereafter, they observed it.

Beyond the deteriorating ramparts, a gust cut sharply through the rain, moving with such speed it resembled a bolt of light, culminating in a dazzling explosion.

Sssssshhh, crack!

The group of martial artists blinked in unison. Touching their faces instinctively, they found their hands covered in sticky blood.

Slowly, their mouths agape in horror, they turned their heads.

As time seemed to slow, they saw the body of their Unit Leader crumble like a rotten tree.

A hole the size of a fingernail was pierced through his forehead.

"……!"

Silence enveloped them while a silent shockwave hit them all.

Their Unit Leader, a Peak Master revered across the heavens for his prowess, was felled by an invisible assault.

As they grappled with this shock, a silhouette ascended the wall.

And the next moment.

Shhhhhh!

A lethal light struck swiftly from the darkness.

\* \* \*

The First Monster teetered on the edge of insanity. In truth, he had been ensnared by madness for over fifty years, but now his condition worsening with each passing moment.

"Why! Why! How!"

Bang! Bang! Bang!

His double axes unleashed a blood-red Qi, wreaking havoc in all directions.

The once grand hall of the Tang Family of Sichuan's Patriarch was now nothing but rubble.

Amidst this chaos, a figure deftly maneuvered, evading the onslaught.

"Ah! Eeh! Eeng! Huk!"

Witnessing Cheong Pung's agile dodges and weaves, the First Monster's eyes bulged with disbelief.

"This damn mutt……!"

It was enough to drive anyone mad.

The opponent was barely more than a child. His background as a disciple of the Sword Saint and having achieved Transcendence shouldn't bridge the chasm carved by time.

The First Monster, a daunting figure from a bygone era, wielded immense strength and wisdom, and was still a martial artist of the highest caliber.

Thus, at first, he might have been surprised but did not feel any significant sense of danger.

'The Sword Saint has nurtured quite the exceptional talent. The Demon Lord's cautionary advice makes sense now. But he has a long way to go before he can contend with me. Haha.'

But his smirk soon morphed into fury.

"Die! I said die!"

He roared maniacally as his double axe descended, unleashing a surge of Qi that enveloped Cheong Pung.

The Crimson Slaughter Net. This technique, a legacy of the Crimson Slaughter Demon who bathed the jianghu in blood three centuries ago, was infamous. \[Note: direct translation - Red Killing Asura Net.\]

As a pariah of the Murim in the Central Plains, the infamous assassin met his demise in a secluded cave on Mount Qilian. The three brothers, having secluded themselves from society, mastered the martial arts detailed in the demon's manuscripts, emerging as the Monstrous Trio of Qilian.

And now, the Crimson Slaughter Net, a technique that no one had been able to perform since the Crimson Slaughter Demon, was being reproduced by the First Monster's double axe.

Swoosh!

That instant marked a pivotal moment.

As Cheong Pung watched the incoming tide of red Qi, his gaze intensified.

Whoosh-

A serene breeze accompanied the purple Sword Aura encircling his blade, effortlessly slicing the Qi net at an angle.

Screech!

The Unified Wisdom Sword, wielded by Cheong Pung, neutralized the formidable Crimson Slaughter Net, stunning the First Monster. \[Note: direct translation - Unified Character Wisdom Sword.\]

"Do you know the martial arts of the Crimson Slaughter Demon?"

No martial art is without its flaws.

Despite being regarded as supreme techniques, the arts of the Crimson Slaughter Demon had their vulnerabilities. These secrets were closely guarded by the Monstrous Trio of Qilian.

Yet, the opponent had accurately identified that vulnerability.

"Aren't you going to respond?"

Cheong Pung's reply was prompt and to the point.

"What's a Crimson Slaughter Demon? This is my first time hearing of it."

"…What?"

"Oh, are you wondering how I countered it?"

Continuing with a tilt of his head, Cheong Pung added.

"I just learned it."

"Did you say learn?"

"If you watch closely, you can learn anything. It just took a bit longer because I'm used to learning from my grandfather. He has more energy and his martial arts are more complex." \[Note: Cheong Pung is saying that he's so used to complex martial arts that he over-complicated things and it took him longer to study the First Monster's moves.\]

"It took longer?"

"Yes. But it seems I won't need to watch anymore."

"……!"

The First Monster realized what Cheong Pung's last words meant in the next moment.

Swoosh!

A purplish glow suddenly dominated his view.

Caught off guard, the First Monster instinctively dispersed his axes with lightning speed to counter the incoming sword strike.

Despite the lack of finesse, the Crimson Slaughter Eighteen Axes boasted unparalleled destructive might. Enhanced by Qi exceeding two gapja, they seemed capable of cleaving the heavens and earth.

However...

Crack!

The sword's blade, with seamless precision, deflected one axe away while simultaneously countering another aimed at Cheong Pung's side.

Boom!

The clash resulted in a reverberating impact, sending the First Monster reeling back, axes in hand, his expression a mix of shock and confusion.

'W-what on earth just happened?'

Whoosh!

Cheong Pung advanced rapidly towards the First Monster.

His gaze intensified, and a sunset-hued purplish energy emanated from his sword.

Whoosh!

The First Monster, dazed, watched as the strike targeted his head.

'T-this is...'

Undoubtedly. The Crimson Slaughter Eighteen Axes. Or rather, now it should be termed the Crimson Slaughter Eighteen Swords.

In mere moments, Cheong Pung had not only unraveled the First Monster's martial technique but had also adopted it as his own.

'How could this be possible!'

With a silent gasp of disbelief, the First Monster launched his axes into action.

Despite the initial shock hampering his speed, he wasn't rendered helpless.

Or so he believed, until Cheong Pung's sword maneuvered anew.

Whoosh.

The sword's potent and ruinous energy descended gently, akin to drifting petals. Thirty-six plum blossoms materialized from the sword's tip, cascading through the air.

A specific martial technique dawned on the First Monster.

'Thirty-Six Plum Blossom Sword.'

Simultaneously, a realization struck.

'It's unavoidable.'

Sssssshhhhh!

Thirty-six plum blossoms, or rather, blades of Qi, shrouded the First Monster. \[Note: think back to chapter 182 of the manhwa when the Sword Saint used this same move on the Blood Lord.\]

His blood misted the air, and, riddled with cuts, the First Monster stumbled backward.

A glint of fear flashed in his eyes upon seeing Cheong Pung, who had just sheathed his sword.

"Cough, you...you..."

"Oh, good. It's raining."

Cheong Pung's voice was steady and composed.

"I hate the smell of blood."

Squish.

Cheong Pung's foot stepped into a puddle of rain and blood. The First Monster screamed in agony.

"Is anyone still here? Quickly! Kill this mutt...!"

Just then, a whisper reached his ears.

"Don't bother calling. You're alone."

"……!"

"……!"

Not a sound of footsteps, not a hint of presence, and yet, he was unmistakably there.

The rain seemed to evaporate before it could even graze him.

"Who are you...?"

Squeak!

With a swift motion, the First Monster's head was severed, flying into the air. Cheong Pung, flicking his sword to clear the blood, now stood before the intruder.

"I'd like to ask. Who might you be?"

Cheong Pung's voice wavered slightly as he continued speaking.

"Mun-Kyung?"
