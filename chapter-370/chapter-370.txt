The Tang Family of Sichuan has been renowned for its seclusion since ancient times.

Even prominent figures found entry difficult. Furthermore, with the family harboring fears that in-laws might divulge their martial secrets and private matters, sons-in-law were taken in to carry the Tang family name.

But merely a week prior, the doors to the Tang Family of Sichuan swung open.

"Over there, straighten the pillar!"

"On the count of three, pull. Ready. One, two-!"

Robust workers tugged at ropes, lifting stone and timber.

On a vast plot, a structure emerged on foundation stones still marked by dark, red bloodstains.

Far off, a congregation of monks recited Buddha's teachings.

"May your spirits, throughout all existence, harbor no thoughts beyond the singular devotion to Amitabha Buddha. With each passing moment, may you be eternally embraced by the radiant light of wisdom." \[Note: in Buddhist culture, it is a norm at funerals to have monks recite Buddhist chants as a guide for the spirit to enter the next realm. I was able to find the original Korean chant book, but did not see any English counterpart. So this is just my translation of the chant. It is supposed to be a chant expressing devotion and a desire to be guided by Buddha's light.\]

These bald, spirited monks were in fact nuns from the Emei Sect.

Before them, wooden coffins were consumed by fire.

"May you be reborn in the Pure Land. We will not forget your sacrifice and spirit." \[Note: the Pure Land is a blissful realm in Buddhist cosmology where individuals can practice and attain enlightenment, distinct from the Christian concept of Heaven as an eternal resting place in the presence of God.\]

Days and nights passed, yet the fire persisted.

The Tang Family of Sichuan bore a significant share of casualties in the Blood History of the Three Great Sects.

"Sigh..."

"Myo-Ryong, you look tired. Perhaps you should rest for a moment..."

"No need, Myung-Jin. There is work to be done, so please don't worry about me. Continue."

The Taoist met the gaze of the pale-faced middle-aged nun before nodding solemnly.

Soon after, sword-bearing martial artists formed a procession, bearing wooden coffins.

Among them were Taoists of the Qingcheng Sect, disciples from lesser sects, and sweat-drenched beggars.

Following them closely were medical practitioners.

"The patient suddenly vomited blood. Wasn't he previously stable?"

"If I knew what was happening, would I be here now? He's definitely sustained serious internal injuries, but I can't figure out what's wrong..."

"Spread out and find the Divine Doctor!"

Emei Sect nuns, Qingcheng Sect Taoists, Beggar Sect members, martial artists from various sects, alongside commoners like carpenters, stone masons, and physicians.

A multitude of people traversed the Tang Family estate, each fulfilling their role diligently.

From atop a tower, through an open window, the young beggar Goong Gi-Bang voiced his weariness.

"To live and see such a sight. And in the Tang Family of Sichuan, no less."

To which Hyuk Mu-Jin, bedridden, responded.

"Don't just watch, go and help out. Stop slacking off."

"Slacking off?"

Goong Gi-Bang, eyes wide, gestured towards himself.

Bandages snugly encased his torso, and his leg was braced with a makeshift splint, marks of honor from his encounter with the Third Monster.

"Look at me. Is this slacking off, huh?"

"Was it only Young Master Goong who got injured?"

Hyuk Mu-Jin scoffed, contorting his body to display his wounds.

Covered entirely in bandages, he bore striking resemblance to a mummy.

"You have to be injured like this to say, 'Ah, this guy had a hard time.' Understand?"

"…!"

Goong Gi-Bang felt a chill. His lesser injuries, a testament to his superior skills, oddly left him feeling outmatched.

"I've changed bandages five times!"

"That's probably because your body was so dirty. I heard that one of the doctors treating Young Master Goong fainted from exhaustion. Is that true? It's a miracle I'm alive!"

"…"

"Enough. Talking more will just bring out the smell of your breath. Speaking of which, next time, ask them to brush your teeth too. Talking with Young Master Goong feels like talking to a street dog's asshole."

What a vicious tongue.

At a loss for words, Goong Gi-Bang stared at the ceiling in despair.

"The Third Monster should have killed you."

"Whoa, aren't you crossing the line there?"

"How the hell did a guy like you survive that fierce battle, I still can't figure it out."

"If you're really curious, why don't you stick with our Squad Leader for a couple of years?"

"…I'd rather not."

On the subject of Jin Tae-Kyung, Goong Gi-Bang and Hyuk Mu-Jin found common ground.

A man synonymous with turmoil. His resilience and ability to weather any storm were unmatched.

And now, witnessing Jin Tae-Kyung's almost unachievable martial skill, it was hard to reconcile this with his past self.

'There's another like him, though.'

'Yeah, that guy.'

Simultaneously, they turned their heads towards the same direction.

"Mimi, whirlwind!"

Ssss!

"Well done, Mimi! Now, try flying in the air!"

Sss?

"Ah, guess that won't work. Then this time..."

Hyuk Mu-Jin and Goong Gi-Bang pondered. Could the goofball attempting to coax flight from a serpent truly be the revered Divine Dragon of Mount Hua, heir to the Sword Saint, and vanquisher of the most formidable among the Monstrous Trio of Qilian, the First Monster?

"Hey, Young Master Goong."

"What."

"Do you have to be a bit crazy to become a Transcendent Master?"

"…I don't know. I really don't know."

Goong Gi-Bang skirted around the answer.

His mentor was certainly unconventional, yet not to the extremes of Jin Tae-Kyung or Cheong Pung.

Looking at the Sword Saint and the Fire King, it seemed possible the disciples had taken after their masters.

"But what exactly is that snake?"

"There's only one snake with such large horns, other than Imoogi. It's a Thousand-Year Venomous Horned Snake." \[Note: an imoogi is a lesser dragon which aspires to become a full-fledged dragon by completing tasks and trials. They are believed to reside in bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes, or clouds.\]

"I read in the Encyclopedia of Spiritual Beings when I was young that it was an incredibly venomous creature cloaked in complete darkness."

Cheong Pung commanded.

"Mimi, lie down!"

Ssss!

"Looking at it, it seems more like a pet than a venomous creature."

"Exactly my thought."

"But why is Cheong Pung here? He wasn't even injured that badly."

"Didn't you hear the loud noise outside earlier? That was Cheong Pung trying to help and ending up breaking the building."

"…Ah."

Rendered speechless, they lay in their beds, gazing at the ceiling.

Despite sustaining damage, the building, now serving as a makeshift medical center, housed critically wounded individuals.

Hyuk Mu-Jin, inhaling the scent of medicinal broth wafting through, whispered.

"It feels like a dream."

"Indeed."

It had been about seven days since the Blood History of the Three Great Sects occurred.

The sinister Dark Heaven forces, having spilled blood across Sichuan, were largely subdued or captured, and the elusive Third Monster was apprehended by an unidentified formidable entity, marking a swift conclusion to the chaos.

But...

"This doesn't seem like the end. What do you think, Young Master Goong?"

"If this were the end, I would already have their intestines in the palm of my hand."

They weren't the only ones who felt this impending doom.

In a scant couple of months, both Henan and Sichuan were drenched in bloodshed.

As the tale of the Blood History of the Three Great Sects disseminates across the continent, it will become clear to all.

The ominous shadow of Dark Heaven looms closer than ever before.

Undoubtedly, this marks the onset of turbulent times, from which heroes are often born.

Hyuk Mu-Jin's eyes involuntarily shifted to the sealed door.

"When do you think Squad Leader will wake up, Young Master Goong?"

"How would I know? According to Mun-Kyung, there's no problem, so all we can do is wait."

"Speaking of which, Mun-Kyung may be skilled for his age, but isn't it a bit much to entrust him with the role of Head Physician?"

"The Divine Doctor is too busy. Grandmaster Jeok Cheon-Gang is still recovering his strength, and with critically ill patients like Grandmaster Tang Sa-Dok, there's no choice."

"I understand, I do, but even if he's a disciple of the Divine Doctor, Mun-Kyung is still... How much can such a young boy really know?"

At Hyuk Mu-Jin's anxious remarks, Cheong Pung abruptly became animated.

"Don't say that. You'll die."

"Young Master Cheong?"

"Don't say what you just said, especially not in front of Mun-Kyung."

"What? Why all of a sudden..."

"No, just don't. Really, don't."

"…?"

Confused, Hyuk Mu-Jin and Goong Gi-Bang exchanged glances, when Cheong Pung suddenly exclaimed.

"Mimi! Where did you go, Mimi?"

As Cheong Pung frantically searched for the vanished Thousand-Year Venomous Horned Snake, a muffled exclamation came from the other side of the steadfast door.

"Hey, you snake bastard!"

Their looks interlocked in midair.

In unison, various cries for the same individual resonated loudly throughout the pavilion.

"Savior!"

"Squad Leader!"

"Jin Tae-Kyung!"

At this call, a stir arose among the individuals outside engaged in their duties.

"Did you just hear that?"

"Has he woken up?"

"Inform the Sect Leader immediately! Hurry!"

\* \* \*

I had a nightmare.

In the impenetrable darkness, a snake slowly constricted around my neck.

Struggling for breath, my field of vision erupted in stark whiteness.

Then, abruptly, I released the breath I'd been holding and my eyes fluttered open.

"Cough!"

Ssss.

"...?"

Ssss? Dammit, what is this?

Confusion set in for three seconds.

Acknowledging the reality of my nightmare, I seized the horn of the serpent ensnaring me.

"Hey, you snake bastard!"

Its name, Mimi-chan or whatever, was irrelevant. Henceforth, it would be snake wine.

"From today, you're only going to live on iseul. Chamiseul." \[Note: Chamiseul is a brand of soju. He's saying the last two characters of the name, which could also translate to "dew" in English. But Chamiseul, the last word he says, is a brand of soju. Basically he's going to pickle the snake in wine, which is actually a thing that many Asian countries do to make their wine "stronger".\]

Just as I was poised to hurl it to the ground with force, the door burst open, and someone barreled through.

"Savior!"

Cheong Pung's voice thundered.

Trailing him, I could see Hyuk Mu-Jin wriggling and Goong Gi-Bang limping toward me.

"Squad Leader!"

"Jin Tae-Kyung!"

"...Why do you guys look like that?"

Hyuk Mu-Jin, with effort, bounced to remain standing and retorted.

"The Third Monster. That crazy Old Monster did this to me."

Goong Gi-Bang chimed in with a gentle clarification.

"Surviving was a stroke of luck. That crazy Hyuk Mu-Jin mixed mud with stones and threw them at the Third Monster. If the Seven Divine Nuns hadn't stepped in to block it at the right moment, I would have been torn to pieces."

"...?"

Wait, who are the Third Monster and the Seven Divine Nuns? Kim Sun-Ja was the name of my high school student counselor... \[Note: Seven Divine Nuns in Korean is pronounced "Chilsunja", so the author is making another phonetic joke.\]

'These crazy bastards.'

A fleeting relief from escaping the underground prison gave way to a burgeoning headache as I cradled my forehead.

They were meant to be staying at the Divine Doctor's abode, yet impatience drove them into a perilous confrontation.

It's a good thing they were able to help, but what if they had died?

"Do you guys have a death wish? What kind of trouble did you get into again?"

"…?"

"…?"

"What, why?"

Their puzzled faces caught me off guard.

The three of us, excluding Cheong Pung, exchanged confused looks.

"Is there a problem?"

"Of course there is."

"The Squad Leader told us to go and save the Emei Sect."

The first response was from Goong Gi-Bang, and the next was Hyuk Mu-Jin.

I scowled, disbelieving their absurd claim.

"What are you talking about? Me?"

"Yes. That's what we heard from Mun-Kyung. Did you hit your head or something?"

No.

The moment I opened my eyes, I could feel it - a formidable force surging within me.

The clarity of my vision and the vibrant energy of the natural world felt unprecedentedly sharp.

'This is what Transcendence feels like...'

I was eager to explore this newfound strength. And a backlog of system notifications must be waiting for me.

Yet, before indulging in further discourse, a crucial question demanded precedence.

"Is everyone safe?"

They would know who I meant by "everyone."

Cheong Pung, with a beaming smile, flung the window open.

"Savior, please see for yourself."

Drawn as if by a spell, I approached the window.

A gentle spring zephyr caressed my face, and the serene quietude outside enveloped me as I surveyed the scene.

"Ah."

Gazing downward, words failed me.

Below were gathered individuals of various callings.

Nuns, Taoists, artisans such as carpenters, and doctors clad in white. The myriad eyes that met mine held a singular emotion.

'Reverence.'

Then, as though on cue, they paid homage in unison.

Fist-and-palm salutes, modest nods, and deep bows were offered in my direction.

In that moment, their voices merged into a formidable chorus.

"We greet the Divine Scorching Fire Dragon!" \[Note: direct translation - Fire Divine Dragon\]

A thrill cascaded from the crown of my head to my feet at their proclamation.

Ding.

- Your achievements and fame will resonate throughout the entire Central Plains.

- You have acquired a new title!

Amid these system alerts, my gaze caught a distant figure.

- Well done.

I laughed along with Jeok Cheon-Gang.
