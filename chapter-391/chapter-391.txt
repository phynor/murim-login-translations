"Hey, hey."

Tap, tap tap.

A foot nudged his side. As Wu Hei-Xing's eyes fluttered open, a towering figure loomed above, peering down.

「Ugh...」

"I've got urgent matters to attend to, so I have to go now. If someone comes looking or anything, just deal with it yourself."

「Ugh, ugh...」

"I've poured a potion on you, so stop exaggerating your agony, dude. Keep this up, and I'll call Magic Johnson over to make you really moan. I'm off then!"

Snap!

The figure's presence swiftly vanished, but not before leaving a chilling remark that makes your butt tingle.

About ten minutes later, Wu Hei-Xing rose, unleashing a thunderous shout.

「Jin Tae-Kyung...!」

Although a high-grade potion had mended his bones and flesh, the lingering pain and the fissures in his pride remained unhealed.

'How is this possible?'

The reality was astounding. The notion that he, an S-rank hunter, could be so utterly outmatched was inconceivable.

The humiliation of having his martial arts seen through by Jin Tae-Kyung compounded the injury to his pride, rooted deeply in his self-assurance.

'Me, of all people?'

Wu Hei-Xing was born with the destiny of a Hunter.

During his infancy, he underwent a Mana Adaptability Test that cost a fortune, which confirmed his potential, and his family, being among the top echelons of the Chinese Communist Party, spared no expense in supporting him.

With vast wealth and power amassed through corruption, Wu Hei-Xing grew up in the best environment and support system, awakening as an A-rank Hunter when he turned twenty and astonishing everyone by becoming an S-rank Hunter ten years later.

But then...

'Why? How could I lose to a nobody from a small country!'

A blend of rage, envy, and a hint of dread at Jin Tae-Kyung's displayed strength.

These emotions surged through Wu Hei-Xing as he stared into the night sky.

Such sentiments were not foreign to him, having tasted their bitterness for years.

Now, he cried out to someone who could no longer be found.

「Is this your doing? Are you tormenting me even in death?」

While the public and media branded him as a hopeless case and simultaneously praised him as a genius birthed by China, only a very few, including Wu Hei-Xing, knew the truth.

That a true genius existed elsewhere and had been deliberately hidden.

「Answer me, Lei Fei!」

Lei Fei, distinguished by his peerless skills and virtuous nature, stood as a formidable barrier for Wu Hei-Xing. \[Note: this is the Minister of National Defense's nephew mentioned in Chapter 383 who went missing in the initial skirmish before the MC arrived.\]

His emotions were a mix of turmoil and relief upon learning of Lei Fei's mysterious vanishing.

Yet, merely a week later, a new obstacle emerged, bearing the name Jin Tae-Kyung.

「Aaaah!」

A deafening roar shook the foliage.

"I know that feeling all too well."

Hearing a gentle voice approach stealthily, Wu Hei-Xing reacted with the swiftness of a bolt.

「Who's there?」

"I'm sorry, I thought we were acquainted."

Step.

Emerging from the shadows, a figure caught Wu Hei-Xing's gaze.

「You are...?」

Bathed in soft moonlight, Lee Jeong-Ryong offered a grin.

"Perhaps we have matters to discuss. What do you think?"

「......!」

\* \* \*

Ding.

\- \[Qi cultivation\] completed!

\- The level of \[Scorching Sun Divine Arts\] has slightly increased!

Energized and eyes wide open, daylight flooded the scene.

As if on cue, the Skeleton Warlord spoke.

\- You vile human. Are you finally awake?

"I didn't sleep, buddy."

\- Drinking alcohol before a battle, tsk tsk.

"I can't get drunk anyway, so just be quiet."

If you drink a lot, alcohol poisoning can build up, but any decent Master like myself can easily expel it.

Not to mention someone with Scorching Yang Qi like me.

'Now that I think about it, I did drink a lot. Enough to finish all the alcohol Fei Chen had brought on her private jet.'

I was supposed to be stopping Magic Johnson, but the events that unfolded remain a blur.

\- But human. How long do you plan to stay in this cramped place?

"I was planning to go now anyway."

Glancing at the clock, it showed five-thirty AM. Time to prepare for departure.

After gathering my belongings in the temporary hotel accommodation, I descended to the lobby, spotting Mr. Choi savoring his coffee.

"Oh, Team Leader."

"…You're up."

Observing him, the dark circles under his eyes were pronounced. His skin, typically impeccable from diligent care, appeared worn and fatigued.

"Didn't you sleep?"

"With Jin Tae-Kyung around, how could I?"

"…"

Fair enough.

The scene I rushed to last night, after receiving the most urgent call of my life, was utterly disastrous.

‘Hey, Choi. This is just a drinking game. Let's keep it cool, shall we?’

‘Ms. Fei Chen! Please help, Ms. Fei Chen!’

‘Um… Sorry, but this is a drinking game. The king's command is absolute. Isn’t that the rule?’

‘Even so, a kiss! This is my first time playing a drinking game! You didn’t even explain the rules properly!’

‘Ah. Forget it, forget it. Number 2 will kiss number 3 on the cheek. That’s my command.’

‘Choi. Just stay put. I don’t want to cast a binding spell on you.’

‘This is nonsense… Jin Tae-Kyung! Over here, Jin Tae-Kyung!’

‘Jin. Don’t interfere. I don’t want to use an attack spell on you.’

If I had arrived even a minute later, the situation would have escalated disastrously.

Despite having to consume a significant amount of alcohol to extricate Mr. Choi, I harbor no regrets. The promise of ample compensation stands.

"You remember the promise you made yesterday, right? About adjusting my settlement ratio."

"…I’m aware. 9 to 1."

Mr. Choi shot me a frosty stare.

"How could you do that in such an urgent situation? Are you even human?"

"Then why not give him a big kiss now? Look, here comes number 2."

Though his number is 2, his gay prowess is world-class.

Upon noticing Magic Johnson entering the lobby, Mr. Choi choked on his coffee.

"Ptoo! Please, hide me."

"It seems it’s too late for that."

As soon as I ceased speaking, Magic Johnson, having noticed us, greeted us with a hand as large as a frying pan.

"Hey, gays!"

Isn't it usually "guys"? He must have misspoken...

At that moment, Magic Johnson approached Mr. Choi and me, his laughter booming, leaving us questioning what we'd heard.

「No need for alarm. I got overly aroused yesterday and pulled a little joke.」

"…You were aroused?" \[Note: the "excited" being used here is the same word for "aroused".\]

「Well, it turned out that way.」

"Please be careful with your words. You really startled me."

「Haha. Anyway, there was a bit of a...situation...yesterday.」 \[Note: the word for "situation" can also be translated as "ejaculation".\]

"…What kind of situation?"

「Huh? Oh, not that kind of situation.」

"Really, be careful with your words. You genuinely scared me."

"Please, both of you, stop. I’m afraid someone might hear."

Mr. Choi, appearing relieved, finished his coffee in one gulp and turned away.

Unbeknownst to us, a group entered through the hotel's main entrance and approached.

「It's time to leave, gentlemen.」

The voice belonged to Minister of National Defense Wei Feng-Hu, whose tone carried an edge of urgency.

He and an elderly military general began distributing folders to each of us.

"What's this?"

「These are the details of the areas and troops you'll be stationed with. We've already secured the necessary information and contacts on the other side. You'll be flying out on a designated jet.」

In our technologically advanced age, such conveniences were indispensable.

Following Wei Feng-Hu, we soon arrived at a temporary airfield, greeted by familiar faces under tight security.

「Did you sleep well, youngsters?」

「...」

"We're late."

Fei Chen, yawned and offered us greetings. Wu Hei-Xing, however, silently looked down, perhaps because of what happened yesterday. Lee Jeong-Ryong wore a strange smile.

The Skeleton Warlord, tucked away in my inventory, voiced its discontent.

\- Somehow, that human leaves a bad taste. This commander does not like him one bit.

"I agree."

Fei Chen, catching the quiet comment, quirked an eyebrow.

「Huh? What did you say?」

"Nothing. By the way, where's Prince Felix?"

「He left just before dawn. There was a signal of engagement in the region he's been assigned to.」

"…I see."

Another battle unfolding less than 24 hours after our arrival.

The reality of "war" suddenly became palpable, igniting a sense of dread.

Despite our different nationalities and backgrounds, the thought of human lives being brutally slaughtered somewhere weighed heavily on my mind.

「Hey there, young man.」

"Yes?"

Fei Chen, her gaze fixed on me, gently nudged my shoulder.

「Relax your shoulders. How can you swing a spear properly if they're that tense?」

"…"

「Don't blame yourself, and there's no need to be in a hurry. Don't try to bear the responsibility for every death.」

Contemplating her words, I responded with raw honesty.

"…Well, I'm not so sure I can do that."

「For someone concerned about such things, you sure did drink a lot yesterday.」

"That's…"

「I know, just joking. People like us need to forget our burdens somehow, especially when we might die tomorrow, or even today.」

Her lighthearted tone belied the gravity of her words. The warrior, a veteran of the Great Cataclysm, cast her gaze skyward.

「Ah, it's perfect weather for a fight.」

With that, she moved towards the jet, which was poised for departure.

Her departing words floated back.

「Let's all… see each other alive.」

She vanished into the plane's interior.

Magic Johnson, his eyes skyward in contemplation, suddenly called out.

「Hey, Choi.」

"Yes?"

「Relax your butt too.」 \[Note: I think he meant to say "you should loosen up".\]

"…"

「No, relax your shoulders. Let's see each other alive again.」

It seems like he was being sincere after all.

Observing Mr. Choi's cautious demeanor, Magic Johnson chuckled and boarded the jet alongside Fei Chen.

Wu Hei-Xing briskly followed, and then Lee Jeong-Ryong, lingering last, shared a thoughtful look with me and Mr. Choi.

"Both of you, take care. It wouldn't do to meet an untimely end in such a place, at your young ages."

Such an old-fashioned way of speaking. Truly, a significant remark.

While Mr. Choi's face was set hard, I opened my mouth with a smile.

"Indeed. It's far too early for either of us to meet our end. Others on the other hand..."

"…!"

"If you do end up passing away, I'll make sure your funeral contributions are generous." \[Note: in many Asian countries, it is customary to gift money at a funeral. This serves as a way for the community to come together to help the family of the deceased. Then in due time, the deceased's family will pay this forward by doing the same for the next family who loses someone.\]

"Don't hold your breath."

After a moment's pause, Lee Jeong-Ryong added his comment, then led the Ares Guild away. We were left standing alone.

Stretching fully, I lightly tapped Mr. Choi's shoulder.

"Let's go, Team Leader."

"Yes. We should."

"There's no need to be tense. Relax your butt."

"…"

"…It was just a joke. Sorry."

Repeating a joke risks it falling flat.

While gauging Mr. Choi's reaction and making our way onto the jet, a sudden call halted us.

「Unit, attention!」

The command echoed robustly behind us.

Minister of Defense Wei Feng-Hu, amidst the swirling wind, offered a salute.

Mirroring his gesture, the assembled crowd on the airfield saluted in unison.

A tribute to those embarking on a mission to protect their loved ones.

This gesture of respect continued until the jet door sealed shut and we dwindled to a dot in the sky, vanishing from sight.

'Hah, seriously.'

Such a farewell lent a weight to my shoulders.

As I settled into my seat, enveloped in a sudden wave of exhaustion, an unexpected sound caught my attention.

Crackle. Crackle.

\- ...Answer. Respond. This is....

Abruptly, a crackling voice from the cockpit, coupled with an urgent notification, jolted me.

Ding.

\- A sudden quest, \[Worsening Warfront\], has been created.

\- You cannot refuse this quest. Arrive as quickly as possible and defeat the enemies!

"..."

Damn it, my life sucks.

With a heavy sigh, I called out to the cockpit with all the vigor I could muster.

"Sir, full speed ahead!"

\* \* \*

「Update?」

The inquirer was a venerable man, well into his eighties, his visage marked by the passage of time yet his gaze as commanding as ever.

Wei Feng-Hu, his throat tight, addressed the stern presence emanating from the old man on the hologram screen.

「Everyone has departed, President sir.」

「How does the situation look?」

「The magic-induced communication interference and barriers make it difficult to discern the enemy movements, but we're doing our best to track them.」

「If the S-rank Hunters arrive...」

「Their power should be sufficient to turn the tide.」

「Let's not be hasty. Don't let your guard down for even a moment. The lives of many depend on our decisions."

「Yes. I will keep that in mind.」

After the brief communication with Minister of Defense Wei Feng-Hu, Shao Yang, the President of China, sat deep in thought in the expansive conference room.

'How did it come to this?'

It was a crisis unparalleled since the days of the Great Cataclysm. Despite extensive efforts and resources, the relentless advance of the monster horde, led by the Arch Lich, continued unabated.

His priority was to stave off chaos... yet hesitating any longer could mean missing the crucial window to act.

Hence, amidst significant internal debate within the Communist Party, Shao Yang had convened this gathering.

「Ready.」

「...Connect immediately.」

Upon the secretary's words, Shao Yang opened his eyes.

The spacious conference room came alive with the holographic presence of figures, filling the voids around the table.

Fourteen individuals of varying ethnicities and genders materialized, joining Shao Yang to total fifteen.

Each represented their nation's leadership and were members of a unified global coalition.

'The United Nations Security Council.'

The old chairman announced the start of the emergency meeting in a heavy voice.
