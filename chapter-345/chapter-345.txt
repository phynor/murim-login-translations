Even though Murim is a place rampant with murder and violence, there's a rule that once you reach the upper echelons of any faction, you're expected to maintain a certain decorum and receive that same decorum in return.

'Especially if you're the head of a house within the Five Great Families, like the Tang Family of Sichuan.'

Tang Sa-Dok, for instance, was known for his forthrightness, but was unaccustomed to receiving it in kind.

Like now.

"Please lend us the Ring of All Poisons."

"......!"

A completely unexpected request.

As his eyelid twitched momentarily, Tang Sa-Dok retorted.

"Do you believe in such nonsensical stories? I knew you were young, but to be this naive..."

"I just saw your eyelid twitch."

"Nonsense!"

"Your voice gets louder because you're flustered, right?"

"Didn't I say no!"

"Oh, clenching your fist now?"

"It doesn't exist!"

"If I rummage through your pockets and find it, may I keep it?"

"Go ahead! Search! If you don't find it, I'll take your neck instead!"

"Ah, so you've hidden it somewhere else. Then, I will cancel."

"This...!" \[Note: the character used here is 이익 and is most probably the start of another word or sentence from Tang Sa-Dok, but can also be directly translated on its own as "Profit".\]

"Loss...!"

"How dare this damned brat!"

Ah, I should have held back on the last part.

Tang Sa-Dok's eyes rolled back in his head after being hit by a fantastic combo.

Before he could resort to concealed weapons, I interjected hastily.

"Just once! Just lend it to me once!"

"Didn't I say it doesn't exist!"

"Let's assume it doesn't. Just listen to what I have to say."

"Whatever you say, it won't change anything."

"Even if I tell you that I will kill the beast for you?"

"What?"

"I will kill the monster that harmed the Poison King, Grandmaster Tang Sa-Mun."

A beat passed.

"This bloody bastard dares to provoke me...!"

Swoosh.

Energy, green and shimmering like a desert mirage, cascaded over Tang Sa-Dok. His blazing eyes fixed on me as he spoke with measured calm,

"Do you really wish to die?"

"I have a bright future ahead of me, so no."

"Punishing that bastard is the responsibility of our family. Yet, you, an outsider, dare to take it from us!"

Whooosh!

A powerful gust of energy burst forth, rattling the chamber. Shielding the quaking Divine Doctor and Mun-Kyung, I countered,

"Have you had any success?"

"......!"

"The beast is a master strong enough to defeat the Poison King. Moreover, they caused a bloodbath in the Emei Sect, right under the Tang Family of Sichuan's watch, indicating that their strength isn't just in martial arts."

No matter how vast the lands of Sichuan are, it's where the Tang Family has been rooted for ages.

It's like letting the family's sworn enemy escape from the front yard. Tang Sa-Dok's face hardened as he had to return empty-handed despite leading most of the family on the chase.

"Are you blaming our family's incompetence now?"

"Of course not."

If the Tang Family of Sichuan were incompetent, then most of the martial sects scattered across the world should be barred and shut down.

The Nine Great Sects and the Five Great Families are the pillars of Murim. The issue at hand is the monstrous nature of the beast, not a shortfall on the part of the Tangs or the Emei Sect.

"I'm talking about probabilities."

"Probabilities?"

"The beast has martial arts comparable to the Ten Kings and is skilled in evasion. Wouldn't the likelihood of capturing them increase with more helping hands?"

"Our family's Green Shadow Squad are already pursuing them. I have returned temporarily to prepare for any emergencies, but it won't be long before we surely annihilate the creature."

Tang Sa-Dok's gaze pierced me and Cheong Pung.

"Our family is the great Tang Family of Sichuan. We do not need the help of outsiders, especially not from novice scum like you."

"......Sure."

I thought I had already far surpassed the level of a novice.

'And surely that guy has.'

Casting a side glance at Cheong Pung's dumbstruck expression, I idly scratched my head.

"Hmm, I figured it might go something like this."

Given the Tang Family of Sichuan's penchant for autonomy, their reaction was somewhat predictable.

That's why, while en route to the Tang estate, I devised a more enticing strategy.

"Then instead of help from novice scum, what about help from the Fire King?"

"......!"

"Let's say we manage to track down the monster. It's not going to willingly offer its arm for a quick injection of poison needles, will it?"

Those who wish to live versus those who wish to kill. A fierce battle is inevitable.

Deploying their full might, the Tangs could seek vengeance for the Poison King but at the cost of significant bloodshed.

Be they from the branches or the main family, numerous Tang descendants would fall.

"Grandfather, no, Master and I will help you. We'll minimize the Tang Family of Sichuan's losses and leave the monster's disposal to you, Patriarch."

"......Impossible. No matter the cost, our family must resolve this with our own power."

"Your response was a bit delayed."

"This is the path our ancestors have walked, the path that made the Tang Family of Sichuan what it is!"

"I am aware of the path the Tang Family of Sichuan has walked."

The family's bond is tight, a vendetta once sworn is pursued relentlessly, and justice is executed without mercy.

This resilience has earned the Tangs both reverence and fear.

I softly added,

"But sometimes, taking a shortcut doesn't necessarily mean people will point fingers. Especially if the reason for choosing that shortcut is to reduce the sacrifices of one's family members."

Tang Sa-Dok clenched his jaw.

Perhaps he isn't as cold-hearted as he appears.

Even if he was as cold-hearted as he appeared, he wouldn't be a ruthless Partriarch who prioritized revenge over their family.

'Otherwise, he wouldn't have returned to the family.'

But Tang Sa-Dok did come back, likely to defend the family from potential threats and protect those who would be vulnerable in his absence.

"What will you do?"

After a lengthy silence, he finally responded.

"......If - hypothetically - the Ring of All Poisons exists, could it heal Grandmaster Jeok?"

"According to someone I know, it could."

Prompted by my look, the Divine Doctor spoke up.

"We're almost ready. With the addition of the Ring of All Poisons, there shouldn't be any issue with the treatment."

"How long will it take?"

"Fifteen days. Fifteen days should be sufficient."

"Fifteen days..."

Tang Sa-Dok regarded the Divine Doctor, lowering his tone.

"I also examined Grandmaster Jeok's condition. Although my knowledge of poison far exceeds my medical skills, I couldn't determine the nature of his illness. Do you really think it's possible?"

"It is possible."

A confident affirmation cut through the room.

Mun-Kyung advanced, asserting,

"If it's the Divine Doctor, it's possible."

"A foolish boy. Is he your disciple?"

The Divine Doctor responded with a faint smile.

"The patient's revival necessitates the Ring of All Poisons. I understand the desire to conceal such a treasure, but I implore you to offer your help with benevolence and righteousness."

"Benevolence and righteousness, huh? Do you think the same?"

"Me?"

"Speak. I wish to hear your thoughts."

"If you insist."

I offered a nonchalant shrug,

"Rather than benevolence and righteousness, let's call it a matter of gratitudes and grudges."

"Why is that?"

"Because it's the Murim. If someone offers help, it's only right to repay them, according to the laws of our society."

Tang Sa-Dok's weathered face briefly softened with amusement.

"That sounds much better."

"It's not just lip service."

"What if, while Grandmaster Jeok is being treated, the monster escapes far away?"

"I'll chase them down and capture them myself. Ah, but not right away, of course. I won't move an inch until my Master awakens."

"You're a funny man. Even if the monster is someone that you would enjoying tearing to shreds, they are a formidable Master. And you, a mere novice, think you can capture such a being?"

"If I cannot capture it, then I will kill it."

"Ha, haha!"

His laughter erupted, then ceased abruptly.

"The Ring of All Poisons does not exist."

"......Excuse me?"

No way, what is this bullshit?

Has this old man been playing me this whole time?

Just as I was feeling a dull ache in the back of my head, Tang Sa-Dok continued speaking.

"The Ring of All Poisons is nothing but an old legend. Even among our family, it's considered an ancient tale."

"What, it doesn't exist? Really?"

"Nobody knows, and nobody should know."

"Fuck. Then you should have said that from the beginning! Now you're just fucking with me......"

Ssss.

I silenced myself, taken aback.

From Tang Sa-Dok's garments, a white serpent emerged, its gaze piercing mine.

'What's this now?'

Not Voldemort for sure, but why is there suddenly a snake here?

And it even has horns, unlike any snake I've ever seen. As I glared back into the black eyes of the snake, the Divine Doctor murmured,

"The Thousand-Year Venomous Horned Serpent...?"

Merely the name evoked dread.

Tang Sa-Dok, noticing my retreat, laughed softly, caressing the serpent's distinctive head.

"There's no need to be afraid. It's not a dangerous creature."

"The name sounds pretty dangerous, though."

"The Thousand-Year Venomous Horned Serpent?"

"Yes. What kind of name is that? It's not a friendly Golden Retriever... Anyway, does the Ring of All Poisons really not exist?"

"It's not the Thousand-Year Venomous Horned Serpent; it's Mimi."

"Excuse me?"

"Tang Mimi. That's the name I gave it."

A chill ran down my spine...

As Tang Sa-Dok tenderly patted Mimi, his gaze shifted to the Divine Doctor.

"You would know. This creature is not an ordinary Thousand-Year Venomous Horned Serpent."

The Divine Doctor nodded.

"The Thousand-Year Venomous Horned Serpent is known to be a highly toxic and rare creature, entirely black and with a fierce nature. It is impossible to tame. But..."

"As you can see. This one not only looks different, but its temperament is also very gentle."

"But who knows when it might turn. A single drop of its venom could kill a hundred cows, couldn't it?"

"No need to worry. This one has no poison."

"Excuse me?"

"To be precise... it has lost its poison."

After finishing his sentence, Tang Sa-Dok locked eyes with Mimi-chan, no, the Thousand-Year Venomous Horned Serpent.

It was but a brief moment, but there was clearly a connection, and the intelligent snake understood its master's intent.

Shush, shush!

Lowering its head and emitting a soft, metallic hiss, the serpent delicately ejected an object into Tang Sa-Dok's outstretched hand.

With a gentle thud, an item, coated in a viscous sheen, came into view.

'That is...'

A ring.

The ring, crowned with a dark gem that seemed to swallow the light around it, pulsated with a sinister yet captivating glow.

Having neutralized the potent venom of the Thousand-Year Venomous Horned Serpent, it radiated a foreboding beauty.

"Could it be?"

My voice was a whisper, disbelief mingling with awe, as I fixed my gaze on the ring, entranced. Tang Sa-Dok, with a tone of quiet assurance, broke the spell.

"Remember. Nobody knows, and nobody should know."

"Understood."

"Then take it."

He offered the ring, his gesture laden with gravity.

"It is my family's most sacred treasure."

As my hands, unsteady with anticipation, accepted the ring, a chime resounded.

Ding.
