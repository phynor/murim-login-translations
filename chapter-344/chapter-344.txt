Ding.

\- A linked quest, \[Ring of All Poisons\] has been generated!

\- It must be done, you cannot refuse!

The holographic display materialized before me, announcing the quest.

Quest

\[Ring of All Poisons\]

\- The Ring of All Poisons, said to absorb any poison under the heavens, is one of the legendary treasures of the Tang Family of Sichuan and a mythical legend passed down in the martial world.

\- Neither its owner nor its existence is certain, but currently, it is the only solution!

\- Grade: Peak

\- Restriction: Jin Tae-Kyung

\- Mission: Acquire the \[Ring of All Poisons\] (Incomplete)

\- Reward: A large amount of experience points

\- Failure: The death of Jeok Cheon-Gang

“A treasure that absorbs any poison.”

Mun-Kyung affirmed with a nod.

“That's right. That's the efficacy of the Ring of All Poisons. However, there's one problem…”

“That its owner and existence are unclear.”

“Yes, even the Tang Family of Sichuan has denied the existence of the Ring of All Poisons several times.”

The Divine Doctor interjected solemnly.

“That’s why it’s a legend. It has been passed down only through the words of people for too long.”

I paused, then with conviction declared,

“No. It exists.”

“Hmm?”

“The Ring of All Poisons definitely exists. It’s just hidden.”

“How can you be so sure?”

Both the Divine Doctor and Mun-Kyung, the initial discloser of the ring's possible existence, gazed at me, their curiosity piqued.

“Well, the reason is…”

Because of the System.

Because there is a linked quest for the treatment of Jeok Cheon-Gang.

Should the Ring of All Poisons not exist, no quest of this nature would have ever been formulated.

Admitting such a notion aloud, however, would only cast me in the light of madness.

I seamlessly transitioned into further explanation.

"If such a divine artifact existed, do you think people would just sit idly by? The Tang Family of Sichuan is famously unconventional in the martial world, naturally, they would want to avoid troublesome matters."

In a realm where the slightest of provocations, be it over coin or dumpling, could escalate to fatal confrontations, the allure of a divine artifact like the Ring of All Poisons would inevitably attract a maelstrom of greed.

Though it was a vague excuse, the reasoning was somehow persuasive enough that everyone nodded in agreement.

"There's logic in that. In fact, after conducting extensive investigations into the existence of the Ring of All Poisons, we've found..."

Goong Gi-Bang interjected, seizing the opportunity to contribute. I turned to him.

"Enough. Leave the rest of the story here and tell it to Mu-Jin."

"Eh? Stay here? With Hyuk Mu-Jin?"

"What do you mean, Squad Leader?"

"Exactly as you heard."

I pointed at the two dumbfounded figures in turn.

"Hyuk Mu-Jin and Goong Gi-Bang will stay here."

"Why! Why is that!"

"I want to go too! Please don't leave me here with this vicious beggar!"

"What did you say! You damn bastard!"

Smack! Smack!

Indeed, sometimes a good smack is the best remedy. I waved my fist at the pair, both clutching their heads.

"Stop talking nonsense and stay here to guard against any unexpected events. If something happens, Goong Gi-Bang, you contact me immediately."

"Contact? Is there a way to send messages to the Tang Family of Sichuan from here?"

"What kind of bullshit are you spouting? If something happens, you'd better run until your feet catch fire."

"How can you say that!"

"If you don't like it, there are plenty of butterflies in that flower garden. Tame one."

This decision, albeit abrupt, was the product of meticulous analysis.

The choice to leave Hyuk Mu-Jin behind stemmed from his comparatively weaker martial arts skills, particularly in movement techniques, making him less suited for the journey ahead. Goong Gi-Bang was selected to stay as a precautionary measure.

He was a Peak Master in his own right, quick in both wits and feet. He could be counted on to respond to any unforeseen events.

"If anyone has complaints or questions about my decision, speak up now."

"...Put down that fist and I'll ask."

"...I'll just stay here."

An arm shot up, and Cheong Pung, wearing an expression of childlike curiosity, inquired,

"Savior, what about me?"

"You, Young Master Cheong, will accompany me to the Tang Family of Sichuan."

"Why?"

"If left alone, who knows what trouble you'll get into. Don't even step out of my sight for a moment, understand?"

"Yes…"

At Cheong Pung's disheartened response, the Divine Doctor spoke up with an empathetic voice.

"Don't be too hard on him. He seems like an innocent young man."

"Innocent, indeed. Innocent enough to potentially start a wildfire and burn down everything here."

"Haha, surely you jest."

"Within a few days, every thatched house here will be burnt down, and the homeless Old Man Dong will have no choice but to join the Beggar's Sect. I'll bet Mu-Jin's left wrist on it."

"…!"

The room fell silent as everyone's gaze shifted to Cheong Pung, now under intense scrutiny.

"It would be best if he comes with us."

"A wise choice."

"Mun-Kyung, what about you?"

After a brief reflection, Mun-Kyung offered a firm nod.

"I will follow Master as well. The nun from the Emei Sect will be fine as long as she rests."

"I appreciate it."

The most crucial ally at this juncture is undoubtedly the Divine Doctor.

Nonetheless, having Mun-Kyung, a steadfast support to his Master, by my side is advantageous.

'The only thing left is how to obtain the Ring of All Poisons.'

Facing the Ten Thousand Poisons Shura, Tang Sa-Dok, the Patriarch of the Tang Family of Sichuan, will surely reveal the truth. \[Note: the term for "Patriarch" used here is the same as the word for "Family Head" when referring to the leader of the Jin Family of Taiyuan. However, given how much larger and influential the Tang Family of Sichuan is, I have decided to use the word "Patriarch" henceforth.\]

With my strategy in place, I addressed Cheong Pung.

"Young Master Cheong, prepare a carrier and two ropes each. Make sure they're big and sturdy."

"Savior, why do we need a carrier and ropes?"

"We need to move as fast as possible. We can't afford to drop anything, so we'll tie everything up tightly with ropes."

Hearing this, both the Divine Doctor and Mun-Kyung's faces went pale.

\* \* \*

Silence pervaded the dimly lit grand hall, broken only when an elderly man addressed the middle-aged newcomer after a significant pause.

"Fifty years ago, before you were even born, our family faced a great humiliation. Are you aware of this?"

The venerable Ten Thousand Poisons Shura, Tang Sa-Dok, intoned, prompting the younger man to lower his head in acknowledgment.

"How could I not be aware?"

"At that time, I, though young, watched everything closely. Allies died all around us, the armory burned, and halls crumbled. We became the losers and had to retreat from Sichuan."

The decade-long war ended with the victory of the righteous factions, and the Tang family returned to Sichuan to rebuild the clan. However, the scars of that time were deeply etched in everyone's hearts.

"How could this happen again!"

At the moment Tang Sa-Dok's eyes flashed with a green gleam, the middle-aged man gulped as a poisonous energy emanated from the elder's body.

"Gasp."

"How could we face such humiliation once more!"

Squish!

As he placed his aged hand upon the table, it did not merely rest there, but began to corrode both the wood and its metal adornments.

The middle-aged man bowed in a mix of fear and reverence.

"Please calm yourself, Patriarch!"

Despite the younger man's plea, Tang Sa-Dok's wrath was not easily quelled.

His anger was justified. Not only had he failed to find the beast that tortured his father, the Poison King Tang Sa-Mun, but he had also ended up returning after receiving an urgent message from the Qingcheng Sect without achieving any vengeance.

"Who would dare..."

The communication from the Qingcheng Sect was both succinct and staggering.

'To think someone killed the Heaven-Stunning Shinni of the Emei Sect and all three elders by themselves.'

And it wasn't a stealthy assassination but a direct confrontation.

The Heaven-Stunning Shinni was a Transcendent Master who could have claimed a place among the Ten Kings, albeit at the end of their ranks. The three elders present were also Peak Masters with considerable experience.

After defeating the leadership of the Sect single-handedly, the beast vanished like a ghost.

'There can't be two such Masters. It must have been the same beast who harmed my father.'

As his rage subsided, it was replaced by a sense of caution.

He decided to return not just as Tang Sa-Dok's son but as the Patriarch of the Tang Family of Sichuan, and he also did not forget to continue the pursuit of the beast.

"How is the Green Shadow Squad doing?"

"They are divided into ten teams of five, spreading out from the capital to Qingcheng, Emei, Suining, and Neijiang to perform their missions." \[Note: the two places besides Qingcheng and Emei are directly translated as Iksan and Samhap. Iksan is a city in South Korea, and Samhap is not a place at all. I was unable to track down the direct references, so I have used Suining and Neijiang here as cities in the northeast and southeast directions of Chengdu. I think the original intention is to have the teams spread out in four directions. I will update this if it comes back to haunt me later.\]

The Green Shadow Squad, known for their prowess in reconnaissance and stealth, had been instrumental in purging threats after the Great Faction War.

Yet, amidst their efforts, Tang Sa-Dok sensed an impending storm, a premonition urging vigilance.

"We must not be complacent. Strengthen the defenses of the Water Gate and deny entry to everyone."

"As you command."

"Leave us for now."

As the middle-aged man started to exit, Tang Sa-Dok interjected.

"After this matter is concluded... pass on your position as the guardian of the gate to another and move to the inner hall."

"M-My lord?"

"I'm speaking to you as your uncle, not as your lord. You're nearing the age of forty, did you think I'd leave my only nephew in charge of the gate forever?"

"Th-thank you, Uncle."

Tang Sa-Dok dismissed him with a wave of his sleeve.

His nephew was of average talent, neither distinguished nor deficient. Merely a nephew.

Despite becoming numb to the pain of it over the years... it was only recently that he thought of his brother, who had lost his life during the Great Faction War.

"It seems I've aged as well, Father."

In solitude, Tang Sa-Dok spoke, his reflection interrupted by a subtle movement at his chest.

Hiss. Hiss.

Emerging was a serpent, its scales as white as snow, eyes a piercing blue, crowned with a triangular head and dual horns.

This creature, the Thousand-Year Venomous Horned Serpent, notorious across the martial realm for its lethal nature, affectionately flicked its tongue across Tang Sa-Dok's face.

"You little..."

A rare softness touched Tang Sa-Dok's usually severe demeanor.

His aversion to most living things was well-known, yet he harbored affection for this serpent, the Thousand-Year Venomous Horned Serpent.

It was the first and last gift from his father, the Poison King. This serpent held a bond deeper than any human connection for Tang Sa-Dok, who was childless and solitary.

"Ah, that tickles, you little rascal."

A soft smile played on his lips at the serpent's playful behavior. Then, the sound of hurried footsteps prompted the serpent to swiftly coil within Tang Sa-Dok's lap.

"What is it?"

"My lord, it's me."

The voice belonged to the nephew who had just departed, prompting a slight frown from Tang Sa-Dok.

"What brings you back so soon?"

"Well, those people from before have returned."

"Those people?"

"Jin Tae-Kyung, the Sleeping Dragon of Shanxi, and Cheong Pung, the Divine Dragon of Mount Hua."

"I made it clear that they are not allowed entry. They are to be denied."

"But... it seems the Divine Doctor is among them."

"What? The Divine Doctor?"

The revelation momentarily caught Tang Sa-Dok off guard.

The Divine Doctor? A figure renowned for transcending mortal bounds in the realm of medicine, shrouded in mystery and unseen for generations?

'Why would the Divine Doctor come to see me?'

His concern was short-lived. A raspy voice escaped from between Tang Sa-Dok's lips.

"Let them in."

\* \* \*

"Are you the Divine Doctor?"

Tang Sa-Dok's directness was unexpected, almost disarming.

We struggled to mask our surprise, but the Divine Doctor responded with a light-hearted laugh.

"My name is Dong Bong."

"So, you're not the Divine Doctor?"

"The world has given me a name too generous for my person."

"It seems so."

"You believe easily."

"Unless one wishes for death, nobody would dare lie in front of me."

"..."

Silence fell, his point undeniably compelling.

For a moment, we stood speechless under the intense scrutiny of Tang Sa-Dok, his eyes emitting an unsettling green luminescence.

"Divine Doctor... Why have you come looking for me, when the whole world searched for you and couldn't find a single hair? And of all the people in the world, you've come with these young martial artists."

"May I speak?"

I stepped forward, locking eyes with Tang Sa-Dok.

"Go ahead. But be prepared to turn into a puddle of blood if you speak nonsense..."

"Please lend us the Ring of All Poisons."

At the straightforward and bold request, Tang Sa-Dok's eyes fluttered in surprise.
