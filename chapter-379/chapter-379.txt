Creak!

A massive rumble shook the ground.

A twenty-year-old hunter, Shao Shen, gazed at the horizon with disbelief etched on his face.

'How could monsters, supposed to be thousands of kilometers away, be here?'

Shao Shen wasn't the only one thinking this.

Everyone at Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport shared this incredulity and horror at the reality confronting them. Approximately a thousand hunters from the Public Security Force and five thousand soldiers of the People's Liberation Army had been deployed to maintain order.

\- Screech!

\- Roar!

From low-tier monsters like goblins and orcs to their higher-tier counterparts - trolls, ogres, and lycanthropes.

The horizon was swarmed by a vast army of monsters, advancing with ferocious cries.

They quickly enclosed the mere kilometer between monsters and soldiers, inciting panic in all gathered at the airport.

"Form ranks for each unit! Assemble the formations!"

"Fire, fire! Fire, I said!"

Ratatatat!

Upon their superior's command, the People's Liberation Army hastily organized and unleashed a barrage of gunfire, albeit with minimal impact.

The onslaught of monsters was simply too massive for ordinary soldiers to make a dent.

These ordinary soldiers, devoid of any special powers or strengths, were frozen in fear, their gunfire barely effective against the low-tier monsters.

"There are too many monsters!"

"Pilot!"

"Quick, launch the fighter jets! Bombard them from above...!"

These urgent orders were instantly muffled by a thunderous roar from above.

\- Screech!

"T-that's...!"

"Wyvern! It's a wyvern!"

A colossal silhouette blocked the sunset.

A wyvern, known as the terror of the skies, led the charge, followed by scores of griffons and gargoyles.

The A-rank monsters, their vast wings slightly angled, swooped down on the yet-to-take-off fighter jets.

Thunk! Kwang!

Their mighty wings stirred the air, lifting tons of metal effortlessly, while their magic-infused talons shredded through the aircrafts' exteriors as if they were paper.

An explosion sent metal shards hurtling through the air with ferocious velocity, striking the pilots as they attempted a frantic escape.

Boom! Crack!

They met instantaneous deaths, void of even a single scream.

Obeying the commander's directives, gunfire erupted, but the magic-infused skin and hide of the creatures were merely grazed by the relentless barrage of bullets.

\- Kiakiak.

The monsters' taunts, ridiculing the humans' helplessness, sent shivers down the spine of every person, their hair standing on end from sheer terror and shock.

"This, this can't be."

The monstrous horde, dominating both land and sky, seemed invulnerable to the barrage of gunfire.

"Monsters..."

"I-I have to survive. I don't want to die in a place like this!"

The terror of impending death spread more swiftly than any disease.

As the People's Liberation Army began to retreat, one individual boldly advanced against the tide.

"Do not retreat!"

Shao Shen, a young man whose youthful spirit had not yet subsided, bellowed with eyes aflame with determination.

The Five-starred Red Flag of the People's Republic of China was prominently displayed on his armor.

"Who are we?"

His challenge halted those in mid-retreat, anchoring them in place.

Facing the monstrous onslaught mere hundreds of meters away, Shao Shen's voice, powerful and commanding, resonated from beneath his helmet.

"Who are we?"

His shout rallied the troops, stirring their spirits.

Before them all, Shao Shen lifted his spear.

"We are the descendants of China, brothers of the People's Liberation Army and the Ministry of Public Security and Military Affairs!"

A radiant aura burst from the spearhead, raised skyward as though to pierce the heavens itself.

Tsstsstsstss!

"Let's go! Let's eradicate these monsters!"

"Waaaaah!"

A thunderous roar from the assembled forces shook the ground beneath them.

At the forefront, hunters from the Public Security Force, weapons at the ready, charged towards the monstrous army with the ferocity of unleashed tigers.

"Do not retreat! Show the power of China!"

"Uaaaaah!"

\- Roar!

\- Howl!

Human cries of determination met with monstrous roars, intertwining into a chaotic fray.

Boom!

A clash thundered across the sky and earth, with death descending from every angle.

"Ahhh!"

\- Squeal!

Pop! Crunch!!

Echoes of screams and harsh noises filled the battlefield.

An A-rank hunter's blade, charged with aura, cleaved through a lycanthrope's neck, while an ogre, brandishing a massive club, sent several hunters flying.

As two hunters, pooling their efforts, downed one beast and turned to face another, a vast shadow enveloped them.

\- Screech!

Slash!

A griffon, swooping down swiftly, carved through hunters and their armor with its talons.

As the griffon sought its next victim, a fiery orb hurled towards it.

"Fireball!"

Boom!

Caught in the blast, the griffon fluttered amidst the acrid smoke. The ground-based ranged units, seizing the moment, unleashed their assault.

"Now!"

Bang! Boom!

Arrows, imbued with various magics and mana, struck the griffon.

With its cries of agony, the griffon plummeted, prompting ferocious roars from the other airborne creatures.

\- Kyaaah!

Modern weapons, forged from lead and iron, thwarted the aerial monster assault on the ranged units.

"Fire at will!"

Ratatatat! Boom!

A volley from countless rifles and heavy artillery, supported by dozens of tanks, unleashed simultaneously.

Though lacking the potency of mana, which was the natural counter to the monsters' magic, the concentrated barrage momentarily staggered the airborne threats.

\- Kiit!

"It's working!"

"Aim for the eyes!"

Magic-infused monsters withstand most physical assaults, but their eyes remain vulnerable.

A thin membrane shields their eyes, making them susceptible to damage from concentrated artillery fire.

Seeing the monsters hesitate, the division commander, fervently gestured with his baton.

"More! Pour it on! Make those monsters unable to move…"

Boom!

His command was abruptly silenced.

A green wyvern's venomous breath engulfed an area of about a hundred meters, dissolving the division commander and his staff in its potent acid.

"Commander!"

"The commander…"

In moments, the loss of numerous soldiers and senior officers plunged the People's Liberation Army into disarray.

Officers, volunteers, and soldiers alike were petrified, witnessing the unfolding catastrophe with screams of terror.

"This can't be happening…"

"This isn't right. It can't be! This isn't supposed happen!"

A collective cry of despair resonated with everyone's fears.

Although they were prepared for emergencies, their original task was to greet and guide foreign hunters at Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport.

An assault by a monster legion was unforeseen and horrifying.

"What in the world…"

"We're going to die. We're all going to die."

A forgotten dread swiftly overshadowed the People's Liberation Army.

They were ordinary soldiers, not front-line hunters of the Public Security Force, armed merely with conventional weapons.

Their grim prediction soon morphed into a grim reality far beyond their darkest fears.

\- Feel...power...summon...creature. \[Note: This line as well as line 234 are a series of broken up Korean characters. Someone who speaks Korean may be able to decipher them, but I can't seem to find a good way to combine these characters so that they make sense. I may come back later, but for now, I have made up what I think is being said. For those that are curious, here is the raw Korean: 옴. 느. 하. 소. 유. and 옌. 위. 가. 지. 케!\]

An intermittent voice, like static from a poorly tuned radio, resonated across the battlefield.

A black mist, arising from nowhere and everywhere, enveloped the soldiers.

\- Rise...above...go...now!

Then, a horrifying transformation unfolded.

Swoosh!

Dark magic, like ominous clouds, spread over blood and corpses like a plague.

It imbued the fast-cooling bodies with newfound strength and a bond of servitude.

Crack, crackle.

From a deathly pool, a legion of skeletons arose, reanimated with sinister life.

'Those entities,' reveling in the enslavement of countless souls with unseen bonds, chuckled with dark satisfaction. \[Note: based on the context, I don't think this is the work of the boss monster that the MC came to Sichuan to fight. This seems to imply that there are several lower-level liches or necromancers in the area.\]

\- Kikiki.

\- Hehehe.

\* \* \*

\- Grrr.

Amidst the rumbling, a figure stood up.

Clad in armor adorned with the Five-starred Red Flag and wielding a massive axe, he bore a striking resemblance to the A-rank hunter Shao Shen remembered.

'...Yao Wei.'

Yet, Shao Shen remained silent, refraining from voicing the name.

For he understood that the being before him was no longer the comrade he once knew.

'Ahhh.'

If not for having seen Yao Wei's execution, and if the severed head was not now cradled under his arm, Shao Shen might have mistaken him for a friend.

But the man known as Yao Wei was gone. A different name escaped Shao Shen's lips.

"Dullahan..."

The headless knight. Dullahan. \[Note: I think that most are already familiar with this, but just in case: a Dullahan is a legendary creature in Irish folklore. He is depicted as a headless rider who rides a black horse and carries his own head.\]

The transformation of his friend into a formidable undead entity brought a heated tear to Shao Shen's eye.

"I'm sorry. Truly."

\- Roar!

Shao Shen surged forward like a gust, confronting the charging Dullahan with a battle cry.

Their past was filled with competitive sparring. What began as rivalry evolved into daily challenges, followed by light-hearted banter.

'This young brat has no manners. Would losing once hurt so much?'

'Haha. Let's go eat. Since the loser pays, it looks like Mr. Yao Wei is buying today.'

'I can't believe someone with so much money at home still lights up at the thought of a free meal. Someday, you'll be buying my food.'

Those days are now memories, with no chance of return. Shao Shen would always be the victor.

'Farewell. Thank you for everything.'

Whoosh! Slice!

The Dullahan's axe cleaved through the air, while the power from Shao Shen's spear tore through the Dullahan's torso.

A cut from waist to head. The figure of the headless knight gradually crumbled.

Thud, thump.

Shao Shen, peered down at the fallen Dullahan. As he stared at Yao Wei's face, his eyes lit with fury.

"How dare they. How dare they do this…"

Merely hours before, those who had shared laughter and camaraderie were now twisted into undead abominations.

The Public Security Force members, despite their rigorous discipline, were not devoid of empathy.

Though these soldiers were steeled for the possibility of death, they now truly felt the fear of their own mortality.

"Snap out of it! It's me, Liu Yin-Chin! Yin-Chin!"

"B-brother…"

\- Rumble!

Crash! Boom!

Screams and the specter of death enveloped them. The Public Security Force's numbers dwindled by half, while the monsters seemed to multiply, unrelentingly advancing.

'Is this how I die?'

Shao Shen faced the concept of his mortality for the first time, the gravity of the situation dimming even his resilient spirit to thoughts of despair.

'Since we didn't receive any warning signals, communication must be down, and no support is coming... this is really the end.'

Swoosh!

As Shao Shen cleaved through the encroaching undead, he gazed skyward with a bitter chuckle.

The sunset was breathtaking. Soon, as night fell and darkness came, such a sight would never be seen again.

'It's fortunate. For the last sky I see, this isn't too bad...'

Huh?

Shao Shen blinked, unable to continue his thought.

Something massive was rapidly approaching the battlefield from the sky.

'A plane?'

Boom!

A fiery explosion illuminated the sky, followed by a shout that cut through the chaos.

"Watch out, there are monsters!"

"......?"

\- ......?

Yes, of course there were monsters... What uneccessary declaration was this?

Not just Shao Shen, but all eyes on the battlefield shifted upwards.

This frenzied proclamation resounded, stirring the air.

"Smash them!"

Smash them? What?

Shao Shen soon realized the meaning of those words.

Kugugugung!

The massive body of the plane swept across the battlefield.
