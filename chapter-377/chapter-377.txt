"Have they left?"

A somewhat stout, middle-aged bodyguard responded to the Sichuan Provincial Lord's anxious inquiry.

"Yes. The Yangtze River Water Route Alliance ship that they boarded set sail an hour ago."

"Sigh."

Releasing a profound sigh of relief that caused his stomach to shake, the Sichuan Provincial Lord waved his hand in a dismissing motion.

"Alright, you may leave now. And if there's any news related to the martial artists, report it immediately."

"Understood. But what about the troops stationed near the capital…"

The Sichuan Provincial Lord's brows knit together.

"Listen, bodyguard."

"Yes?"

"Do I really need to concern myself with such trivial details? You all should handle the aftermath. Consult with that stubborn fellow, the Provincial Commander, about it. Alright?"

"..."

Silent shock gripped the bodyguard.

Was this utterance meant in jest or disdain? The Lord's tendency to offload his responsibilities was known, yet this instance seemed egregious.

'It wasn't always this bad, was it?'

Ever since he took the new concubine, years have passed with him indulging in pleasure and neglecting his official duties.

The bodyguard exhaled a profound sigh, feeling a sense of defeat, and offered a languid salute.

"…I shall follow the Lord's command."

"Of course, you shall. Now, off you go. I have urgent matters to attend to."

It was only after this assurance that the Sichuan Provincial Lord displayed a hint of satisfaction and rose.

His excessive girth made his breathing labored as he departed. The bodyguard eyed his retreating figure, whispering faintly,

"What urgent matters? He's probably off to cuddle with his concubine again."

The bodyguard's intuition was remarkably accurate. The Provincial Lord's initial destination post-departure was an opulently adorned bedroom.

"My love! My love!"

A woman, scarcely clad, reclining on a bed of silk vast enough to dwarf an ordinary room, propped herself up.

"Darling, why have you come so late? Your love has been waiting for you."

"Is that so?"

Caught off guard by her coy looks and the glimpses of her pale flesh beneath the coverlet, the Sichuan Provincial Lord's jaw dropped.

"I'm sorry. The bodyguard was being bothersome."

"Is it him again? Knowing how busy you've been, darling, why does he bother you so much?"

"That's exactly what I'm saying."

"This is why those incapable subordinates are a problem. Without you, darling, they can't do anything, can they?"

"Indeed, the only one who truly thinks of me is you, my love!"

Had the bodyguard overheard their exchange, an eye roll would have been his reflex.

Moved, the Sichuan Provincial Lord's face quivered as the concubine extended her arms toward him.

"Come here, darling. You've worked hard, so let me give you a hug."

"My love...!"

Captivated by his favorite concubine's beguiling and honeyed gaze, the Sichuan Provincial Lord's expression turned wistfully tender.

"Can there be any woman as beautiful as you in this world?"

The Sichuan Provincial Lord's lineage boasts three generations of high-ranking officials, paving his way to affluence.

With boundless riches at his disposal, he indulged in the company of numerous beauties across brothels.

If smitten, he would take them as his concubines, yet typically his fascination waned within a year.

'But this one is different!'

He swore he had never seen a woman like her before. Her voice, her gaze, every little movement of her hand - everything about this concubine was enchanting and lovely to the Sichuan Provincial Lord.

Despite years together, his fascination only deepened, ensnaring him further in his affection.

"I love you, my love!"

The Sichuan Provincial Lord's cry was as earnest as a lovestruck youth, though he had just turned fifty.

Magnetized, he drew close to his concubine, the sole confidante for his innermost thoughts, ready to recount the events of the day.

"...And so, those troublesome thugs have finally left."

"Thugs? You mean, the martial artists who visited last time?"

"Yes. The ones who brought the token of His Majesty, the King of the Northern Mountains."

"Hmm."

"What's wrong?"

"Nothing. But, darling, you must have had a tough time with this affair. I heard there was a dispute among the martial artists, leading to many deaths and injuries?"

The Sichuan Provincial Lord grimaced, shaking his head.

"Don't even mention it. They dared to steal our military's uniforms and disrupt the order of the nation."

"Oh my, really?"

"It's hard to believe, but it's true. I might not care about other things, but I must report this to the court..."

"How dutiful of you. But, darling."

With a cunning grin, the concubine gently caressed the head of the Sichuan Provincial Lord nestled in her lap.

"Wouldn't it become a grave matter if the imperial court finds out?"

"Uh, huh?"

"Think about it. Someday, darling, you'll ascend to the position of one of the Three Excellencies, leading all civil and military officials and serving the Emperor... I worry that those envious of you might use this incident against you." \[Note: the Three Excellencies, or sometimes also called the Three Dukes or Three Ducal Ministers, are the highest-ranking officials in ancient China who advised the emperor on governance, military, and administrative matters. They are sort of like a presidential cabinet.\]

"Haha. Indeed, the only one who thinks so much of me is you, my love."

Gazing at his concubine, the Sichuan Provincial Lord's eyes were filled with profound tenderness.

Yet, he was no simpleton.

Despite the unofficial truce between the government and Murim, the past week's toll exceeded a thousand lives throughout Sichuan.

While minor affairs were delegated to his underlings, he recognized the necessity of intervening in matters of this magnitude.

"Your kindness is touching, but hiding such a major issue will only lead to problems."

"Darling, you think I don't know that?"

"Then what do you suggest?"

"We hide what needs to be hidden, and amplify our merits."

Her voice, dripping with allure, caressed the Sichuan Provincial Lord's ears.

"There was a major conflict among the martial artists, and you, darling, mobilized the government troops to calm the situation."

"Hmm."

"You become the virtuous Lord who restored order disrupted by the rogues and cared for the common people. Of course, we should leave out the part about the government's weapons and uniforms to avoid misunderstandings."

"If only it were as you say, my love. But to fabricate a report to the court like that is a bit..."

"Look at me, darling."

Caught between hesitation and enchantment, the Sichuan Provincial Lord was mesmerized by her eyes, shining like onyx.

"Ah."

"Do you not understand my feelings for you?"

"That is, well..."

The Sichuan Provincial Lord was at a loss for words.

The moment his eyes met his concubine's, his mind had already emptied.

Her allure quickened his pulse and her fragrance ensnared him.

A rush of trust and adoration mingled with an overpowering desire, rendering him defenseless.

"My love, my only!"

He proclaimed ardently. Nevertheless, the concubine restrained the Sichuan Provincial Lord's wandering hand.

"Your answer, darling?"

"Of course, I will follow your wishes. I would do anything for you!"

The grin on the concubine's face broadened.

"Well done. Just as you have done so far, continue to do so in the future. You understand, right?"

"Yes, yes!"

Swept up in a surge of overwhelming longing, the Sichuan Provincial Lord was oblivious to the troubling spectacle.

A disconcerting glow of malevolent crimson light clouded the eyes of the concubine he so adored.

"Oh, what a good boy. Our Lord listens so well."

The concubine's laughter rang clear and loud.

Events were unfolding precisely as she — or rather, he — had intended.

\* \* \*

"Huh?"

"What's wrong?"

"I thought I heard some crazy bitch laughing just now."

"A crazy bitch? Here?"

"Yes. It felt eerie."

Hyuk Mu-Jin and I looked around. Three fast ships of the Yangtze River Water Route Alliance sailed unimpeded on a wide tributary of the Yangtze River. Naturally, there were no women to be found on any of these ships.

"Did I hear wrong? Strange."

After all the events we've been through, am I now hearing things?

Hyuk Mu-Jin adopted a grave expression before speaking.

"Could it be..."

"What?"

"The lady standing fourth from the right in the first row. You haven't forgotten her, have you?"

Goong Gi-Bang shook his head.

"Nonsense. It's the third from the left. A beauty unforgettable."

"Oh, so that was what it was about?"

My smile was one of mild amusement as I observed them.

"I think today will be a day neither of you will forget."

As I smiled warmly, I gestured for several of the lingering pirates. They approached rapidly, bowing deeply.

"Did you call for us, Master Jin?"

"Is there something you'd like us to do for you?"

"Catch those bastards and dip them in the Yangtze River."

The pirates, confused, sought clarification.

"Uh, dip them in the river, you said?"

"Sorry, but we're rather simple-minded. What exactly do you mean by 'dip them in the river'?"

"Maybe dipping them isn't the right phrase... Just repeatedly dunk their heads in the water and then pull them out again until I say stop."

"Ah, I see."

"That sounds easy."

"Wait a moment!"

"Squad Leader!"

Goong Gi-Bang and Hyuk Mu-Jin tried to protest, but their efforts were in vain.

One was hobbled by a bad leg, and the other was ensconced in bandages.

As the physically imposing, martially skilled thugs moved in to initiate the dunking ritual, my gaze shifted to the System Window I had previously opened.

\- You have an unnamed bound item. Would you like to check it?

'Of course, yes.'

Ding.

Item Window

\[???\]

Type: Armor

Grade: Divine Weapon

Restriction: Jin Tae-Kyung

Description: An armor imbued with the soul of an ancient warrior and possessing formidable defensive capabilities. Its ownership has transferred to you due to the previous owner's death. Once named, it can be freely used anywhere.

'The previous owner died so the ownership transferred to me?'

I thought as much. It seems like the item I was thinking of.

Digging through my inventory, I located the newly bound object, exhaling in resignation.

"...Sigh."

What lay in my hand was merely a fragment. Once celebrated as the Black Dragon Armor.

'I blew it up along with the Western Heavenly Demon Lord in our last encounter. Why didn't it just automatically add to my inventory as a bound item?'

The scene of the Black Dragon Armor shattering into pieces was still vivid in my mind.

Now, what use could I have for this minuscule shard?

'Maybe I could tuck it into the front part of my underwear.'

Ah, perhaps this is why it's still considered armor.

I began subtly adjusting the front of my pants to find the right spot.

"What are you doing there..."

"...Ah."

An uncomfortable silence followed.

The boy's expression turned stern upon noticing my hand near the loosened waistband of my pants.

Ensuring we were alone, the Rice Saint, or more accurately, Mun Kyung, inquired,

"Why would you do this here?"

"Now, wait a minute. There seems to be a misunderstanding." \[Note: a formal tone is being used here by the MC.\]

I began to clarify hastily, but Mun Kyung's expression softened.

"I mentioned before we set off. Except in front of the Fire King and Cheong Pung, you should address me as Mun Kyung." \[Note: the Dark Saint is telling the MC to use an informal tone.\]

I looked at him, annoyed.

"You're using informal language right now, you little fuck." \[Note: the MC is immediately switching to an informal tone. However, the MC is implying that Mun Kyung should be addressing him in formal tone due to the MC being "older" than Mun Kyung.\]

"…!"

"Ah, my apologies."

Mun Kyung's face briefly flickered with a mix of feelings, then he eyed the approaching pirates and tutted.

The transformation from a fearsome killer to the bright disciple of the Divine Doctor was instantaneous. \[Note: is this some sort of self-imposed multiple personality disorder?\]

"What were you doing?"

"That's none of your business."

"…!"

This interaction is rather amusing, though I shouldn't push my luck.

I promptly offered my hand to Mun Kyung, who was taken aback for a moment.

"I was trying to put this in my waistband."

Admittedly, this was a mild deviation from the entire truth, but Mun Kyung appeared unconcerned with the specifics. His attention was instead captivated by the fragment of the Black Dragon Armor.

"This is…"

"Do you recognize this item? Or know of it?"

"Where did you get this?"

"From that guy."

Understanding that I meant the Western Heavenly Demon Lord, Mun Kyung nodded.

"So, you've obtained a divine weapon. I'm not sure how it ended up as just a fragment, though."

"He called this the Black Dragon Armor."

"Black Dragon Armor?"

"Why, is it different from the name you know?"

"I've read about it in ancient texts. It's a mystical armor with no fixed name, changing in form and nature according to its owner."

"It changes form and nature? How?"

Mun Kyung answered with a look of pity. And then, I realized what I had to do next.

'Qi.'

Fundamentally, Qi embodies the form and nature of its possessor.

Swoosh.

Feeling the flow of the Scorching Yang Qi pulsating within me, I directed a stream of molten-like energy into the Black Dragon Armor's shard.

The sinister energy cloaking the shard dissipated, supplanted by a bluish-white aura radiating intense heat.

Adorned with flame motifs, the artifact could no longer be called Black Dragon Armor.

'Fire Dragon Armor.'

Simple, yet no other name could be more fitting.

Grinning in contentment, the air resonated with a confirming tone.

Ding.

\- You have given a new name to the bound item, \[???\]!

\- From now on, \[Fire Dragon Armor\] can be freely used anywhere!

\- \[Fire Dragon Armor\] resonates with your energy! It seeks the owner's power to repair itself!

Swoosh.

I sensed it. A potent surge of Qi cascaded from my being into the Fire Dragon Armor.

Though I feigned slipping it into my pocket, it was actually secured in my inventory.

'Automatic repair. Awesome.'

This acquisition has proven immensely valuable.

As the Fire Dragon Armor would be the last gift from this journey, I was glad that it would be useful in the days ahead.

Just as I turned to leave, Mun Kyung's gaze, wide with curiosity, followed me.

"Where are you going?"

"That's none of your business."

"…!"

Ah, this is somewhat addictive.

I offered Mun Kyung a casual wave, sensing his effort to maintain composure.

"I'm going to take a nap. Don't wake me up."

"…?"

Indeed, it's high time I emerged from this prolonged slumber.

But...

'Why do I feel so uneasy? What am I forgetting?'

Settling into the ship's cabin, my head cocked in puzzlement, I shut my eyes and inhaled deeply before issuing the command,

'Log out.'

Ding.

\- Logging out in 10 seconds. Ten, nine, eight, seven...

Amidst the countdown, the distant sound of water splashing and a muffled plea barely reached me.

Splash, pfft! Squad Leader, save me, pfft!
