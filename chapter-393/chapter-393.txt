War is a series of battles.

After the day's battle, heavy with bloodshed and mortality, the winners and losers are determined. Those who remain unite to ready themselves for the next confrontation.

The military leaders in charge of the eastern front of Sichuan Province convened for this exact purpose. \[Note: the two S-rank Hunters that were dispatched to this region \]

「The damage is too severe.」

A middle-aged soldier, seemingly in his forties and clad in a bloodied uniform, broke the silence with his fatigued voice.

「We managed to hold the high ground... but we lost over 3,000 troops just today.」

A victory marred by wounds.

The death of 3,000 was grievous, yet the loss of hunters, including commanders and senior officers, making up over 30% of the casualties posed a graver issue.

Despite outnumbering the enemy three to one, the loss was profound.

「Has there been a response from the higher-ups?」

「Of course. After an internal meeting, they've decided to dispatch a new General before dawn.」

「That's somewhat fortunate then. Who is the new General, if I may ask...」

Amid the grave dialogue, an interruption came unexpectedly.

「Fortunate? Do you all really think so?」

「……!」

A pause speaks volumes, particularly when uttered by a celebrated hero of the Great Cataclysm and an S-rank Hunter.

「The attack by flying monsters tore half of our high-ranking officials, including this region's General, to pieces. Our forces were in disarray, and the damage worsened. Can we really call such a situation fortunate?」

Her intense stare caused everyone to recoil.

「Well, that is...」

「Seeing as you're trying to make excuses, it looks like you know it too. However…」

Her tone grew colder.

Fei Chen's scrutinizing eyes halted on one individual.

「Why don't you have an excuse?」

A hushed moment lingered, then Wu Hei-Xing, swirling his drink in his glass, responded.

「Why should I have to make excuses?」

「If you ask why, well...」

Fei Chen’s gaze intensified.

「Perhaps because some idiot abandoned his assigned post, and the monsters that were waiting for him shredded the headquarters to pieces?」

「...I was helping the front lines.」

Wu Hei-Xing's retort was merely a feeble justification. When he abandoned his post, Fei Chen's unit was already effectively countering the monster hordes at the front.

「Ah, there was that too. You went deep to make a name for yourself like a naive child, and that's why our formation was broken. Those kids you chased after to save, their bodies weren't even found, were they?」

「Living and dying are common occurrences on the battlefield.」

「That's right. Common occurrences.」

Fei Chen's voice softened as she continued.

「For someone like you, dying unnoticed is even more common. Looking at it, the world has become overly laxed. If it had been during the Great Cataclysm...」

Fei Chen's words trailed off.

Clink, crash!

The sharp sound of shattering crystal filled the room.

Wu Hei-Xing, having smashed his glass, rose slowly to his feet.

「Is that all?」

「All? Your tongue is quite short, no?」 \[Note: this is an expression for someone who speaks informally or too bluntly.\]

「There's a limit to my patience, Fei Chen.」

「Keep talking. Just remember, the shorter your words, the shorter your lifespan becomes.」

「How dare a traitor from Hong Kong...」

「Ah, are you talking about the person from Hong Kong who cleaned up the shit you left in the front lines?」

Woosh!

A palpable tension surged between them, filling the room with an oppressive force that made it hard for others to breathe.

The standoff between the two S-rank Hunters quickly ended as a sneer formed on Fei Chen's lips.

「Scared, tired, and amidst that, trying to establish military honors. That makes you increasingly impatient, doesn't it?」

「What?」

「Kid, that's what war is all about. It always pushes people to the brink and tests them. To survive in this hell, you need strong mental fortitude. For a spoiled brat like you, it's undoubtedly tough.」

「...!」

Wu Hei-Xing's face contorted grotesquely, each of Fei Chen's words cutting deep.

「S-rank Hunter? So what, if your mind is no better than that of a seven-year-old. You're worse than useless in a war like this.」

「Shut up! What do you know...」

「What do I know? Are you asking me that?」

Fei Chen's mocking laugh turned Wu Hei-Xing's face crimson with fury.

Though he was born with power and wealth in both hands, his opponent was a war hero who had survived the Great Cataclysm with all her limbs intact.

Though she was discriminated against by the media for being from Hong Kong, in terms of experience, Wu Hei-Xing was no match for her.

「Why don't you answer?」

Wu Hei-Xing, his jaw clenched as he avoided a response, surveyed the room.

No one spoke outright, yet their looks echoed Fei Chen’s disapproval.

'Damn it…!'

What further fueled his ire was the presence of allies from the Princelings, a group he had strong ties with. \[Note: just as a reminder, the Princelings make up a faction of the Chinese Communist Party, and are descendants of the revolutionary veterans and Chinese Communist Party elites who leverage their lineage for influence and promote business-friendly policies. The other faction is the Shanghai Clique.\]

The Princelings represented a dominant force within the Chinese Communist Party, and Wu Hei-Xing, a key figure among them, felt deeply betrayed.

「I will clearly remember what happened today.」

With these bitter words, Wu Hei-Xing turned to leave.

As he walked away, reeking of alcohol, Fei Chen’s soft voice followed him.

「Remember this as well. This childish misbehavior stops today. If the same situation occurs again... I won't let it slide next time.」

Grkkk.

Back in his quarters, the first thing Wu Hei-Xing did, besides grind his teeth, was to destroy everything in sight.

Bang! Bang bang bang!

「Damn Hong Kong bitch! Those goddamn traitors!」

In his rampage, the costly luxuries brought on his private jet lay in ruins.

He continued to wreak havoc, howling uncontrollably, until finally collapsing on his bed, out of breath.

「Damn it.」

His fury didn’t ebb.

On the contrary, the more he dwelled on the confrontation, the angrier he became, his heart racing and his vision blurring.

'How dare they treat me like this?'

He had been born into one of China’s most powerful families.

After attaining S-rank Hunter status, the world seemed to revolve around him.

Despite any major blunders, only mild reprimands came from his father. He dismissed criticisms from the public and political opponents alike.

'I am Wu Hei-Xing. Wu Hei-Xing!'

An S-rank Hunter had come to symbolize national influence. Despite public criticism, this fact remained.

Perhaps this explained his preference for media appearances and social gatherings over the grueling realities of combat raids. Why he had abandoned training and turned to substance use.

Yet this war, his first true conflict, presented unrelenting chaos and an endless onslaught of monsters, proving suffocating.

It was proving too harsh for someone accustomed to a life paved with privileges.

Moreover, the reason Wu Hei-Xing kept making mistakes was that the influence of one person remained.

'Jin Tae-Kyung.'

Before him loomed a challenge even greater than his long-time adversary, Lei Fei.

His shadow was immense and ominously dark.

The fear ingrained in his psyche from a past, one-sided defeat seemed impossible to shake unless Jin Tae-Kyung was out of the picture.

'Yeah, unless that bangzi disappears…'

A calculating look flashed in Wu Hei-Xing's eyes as he gazed at the ceiling.

He smiled, reminiscing about the conversation with Lee Jeong-Ryong on the night of his crushing loss. The fiery rage had long since cooled.

'Let's see who laughs last.'

As he relaxed, the fatigue he had momentarily forgotten weighed heavily on his eyelids. Drifting towards sleep, Wu Hei-Xing thought,

'Shit. How many more battles like today will I have to endure?'

Soon after, the completely exhausted Wu Hei-Xing was unaware.

The pitch-black night concealed a mass retreat of monster hordes from the frontline.

A vast migration was unfolding across all fronts in Sichuan Province.

「…Phew.」

Shao Shen, with red-rimmed eyes, sighed.

The guy who had spent the night with his Sleep Point sealed only regained consciousness two hours ago.

Right after waking up, he had been so agitated about killing General Liao that Mr. Choi and I had to work up a sweat to calm him down.

"Mr. Shao Shen, are you okay?"

"Are you calming down now?"

To which Shao Shen responded,

「Yes. When I first woke up, I didn't have any strength in my body, but now I'm fine. I'm strong enough to rip his head off.」

"…"

"…"

Fine my ass.

His trembling fists betrayed his bravado, indicating he wasn't about to use General Liao’s head for golf anytime soon, which was somewhat comforting.

"I'll say it again. I didn't want to do that to you, but desperate times call for desperate measures."

After a brief silence, Shao Shen nodded.

「I know, Hyung. I appreciate you stepping in for me.」

"When did you hear about that?"

「The Company Captains came and told me. They said you flew into a rage and smashed General Liao's limbs.」

"…It wasn't something I should have done after stopping you. But it happened."

Mr. Choi spoke up firmly.

"If it wasn't something you should have done, then why did you do it?"

"Well, in the heat of the moment, I lost my cool."

"It's fortunate that the current situation is so confusing. Otherwise, things could have been bad."

"The current situation being confusing is indeed fortunate. Otherwise, that bastard would have been dead by my hands a long time ago."

An inept leader is more dangerous than any adversary.

General Liao deserves to die for prattling on about the failed mission and costing us a thousand lives.

"It turned out alright. He's almost recovered with the potion. Let's let it quietly pass."

"Grudges last long, Mr. Jin Tae-Kyung. Being a high-ranking general of the Central Military Commission, especially one from the Princelings known for holding grudges, there's plenty of room for problems to arise later."

"What can I do? The milk is already spilled. If problems arise, we'll think about it then."

At my casual reply, Mr. Choi shook his head in disapproval. That’s when Shao Shen spoke up gently.

「Do not worry, Mr. Choi. The issue you're worried about won't happen.」

"Huh?"

"Mr. Shao Shen, have you heard something specific?"

「Rather than hearing…」

Shao Shen paused, then shook his head decisively.

「Um… It's just my personal thought.」

"…?"

"…?"

What's this suspicious smell?

At that moment, when Mr. Choi and I regarded Shao Shen with suspicion.

「C-c-can I come in?」

"…Did an earthquake hit your vocal cords? Come in."

Only then did the figure hesitating outside our tent make his entry.

A familiar face. One of the staff officers closely allied with General Liao.

Just yesterday, this was the man who had been terrified watching me incapacitate his boss.

"The lackey of the great country has arrived. But what for?"

「A g-g-gu…」

"W-w-what do you want to say? Please, speak clearly."

The staff officer, visibly unnerved, swallowed hard before responding.

「A guest has arrived.」

"A guest?"

「Yes.」

"Who's the guest? Do they even allow visitors here?"

It surely couldn’t be my mother and Ha-Yeon.

While I entertained this unlikely notion, the staff officer quickly clarified.

「Magic Johnson, the Hunter from the USA has come.」

Next to me, I could feel Mr. Choi pucker his butt.
