The subterranean cells of the Sichuan Tang Family were shrouded in darkness and humidity with an eerie chill permeating the air.

This ambiance seemed fitting, given the countless souls that had perished within these walls.

"Would you like something to drink?"

The old man offering a battered gourd was like the grim reaper.

I pondered the number of lives this small, stooped figure had claimed before responding.

"I'm fine."

"Suit yourself."

Gulp, gulp.

After a hearty swig from his gourd, the old man dabbed his mouth with his ragged sleeve, marked with what looked ominously like bloodstains.

"Ah, that's good."

A strong scent of alcohol mingled with the smell of blood wafting through the corridor.

Drinking on the job? In the Jin Family of Taiyuan, this would warrant a severe reprimand, but it seems like the rules don't apply in the underground prison of the Tang Family of Sichuan.

"I've heard you're quite the figure in Murim."

It was clear whom he was referring to. Cheong Pung and Tang Sa-Mun had disappeared hours ago, and the Divine Doctor and Mun-Kyung were busy turning the cellblock into a makeshift clinic.

I reluctantly answered.

"I'm not all that remarkable."

"That's not what I've heard. Being a successor of the Fire King, you could even pee on the signboard of one of the Nine Great Sects, so they say."

His grin, showcasing decayed teeth, was unsettling.

"The one who did such a deed is locked up here."

"What kind of deed are you talking about?"

"The one who peed on the signboard of one of the Nine Great Sects. It was the Kunlun Sect, if I recall correctly."

"…Truly, all sorts of people are here."

"Heh heh. He was once recognized as a Demon Head of the Demonic Cult, but he’s now just bound and constantly leaking blood and filth. You must have seen him on your way here?"

"I guess so."

Navigating the Tang Family's dungeon felt like traversing a labyrinth, its corridors twisted and filled with cells. From what I witnessed upon entry, it housed numerous inmates.

'That guy who peed on the Kunlun Sect's signboard must be one of those prisoners.'

They were paying the price for their misdeeds, and not a trace of sympathy arose in me.

No, it would be more accurate to say I had no time to care about such things.

'I didn’t expect to feel this nervous.'

Ever since I stepped into the shadowy confines of the Sichuan Tang Family's dungeon, an unsettling feeling has clung to me.

It reminded me of the anxious anticipation I felt years ago as I awaited news from the surgery room where my mother was.

'Everything will be okay. It has to be.'

While whispering reassurances to myself, the heavy door to the dungeon swung open, releasing a stream of servants laden with cleaning supplies into the corridor.

To the last person emerging, I inquired,

"Is it finished?"

With a reassuring smile, the Divine Doctor confirmed.

In just a few hours, the gloomy cell had been converted into a makeshift yet serviceable medical chamber.

"It's not yet up to satisfactory levels, but it's somewhat presentable now."

"Then..."

"Yes. It's time to begin."

Finally, all preparations were completed.

The various medicines created from twenty-four types of herbs mined from the Frozen Tundra had already been brought in. With the medical chamber prepared, only one step remained.

"Thank you all for your hard work. Could you please step aside for a moment?"

Heeding my request, the Tang Family's personnel, including the old man with his gourd, stepped back. I waited for the space to clear before delving into my pocket.

'Inventory open, summon.'

A hard object filled my previously empty hand. For safety reasons, I had been holding onto the Ring of All Poisons, which I now handed over to the Divine Doctor.

With the ring now on his finger, the Divine Doctor motioned towards the interior of the cell.

"Could you bring the patient over?"

I maneuvered the stretcher forward, revealing a barely breathing figure.

"Over here."

I stepped into the prison, holding Jeok Cheon-Gang. The floor was clean, but there was still a lingering stench.

But that didn't matter. I could only focus on how light Jeok Cheon-Gang felt.

'He's gotten much weaker.'

It had been about a month and a half since we left the Murim Alliance of Hanam for this journey.

I found the Divine Doctor much faster than expected for the treatment, but Jeok Cheon-Gang was growing weaker by the day.

Sigh.

Gently, I laid him on a white, smooth stone in the center of the room.

This Cold Ice Stone, gifted by Tang Sa-Dok, was chosen by the Divine Doctor as a crucial element for Jeok Cheon-Gang's recovery.

"He's sleeping peacefully."

Jeok Cheon-Gang's features, though emaciated, radiated tranquility as he lay before me.

I gazed intently at his face which was marked by wrinkles and age spots.

I was transported back to our first encounter.

'What an interesting fellow.' \[Note: manhwa chapter 114.\]

'The more I see you, the more strange I find you. Where did you say you were from?' \[Note: manhwa chapter 115.\]

I vividly remembered the cantankerous old man I had met at Jang Tae-Bo's house a year ago.

'This inn has gotten too old... The rain's leaking through the roof.' \[Note: manhwa chapter 118.\]

I remembered a mentor mourning his inability to protect his pupil, blaming the fully intact roof while shedding tears of regret.

'If you kill him, you'll die too.' \[Note: manhwa chapter 127.\]

'I entrusted the Divine Object of the Scorching Clan to him.' \[Note: manhwa chapter 128.\]

'I'll teach you all that I know!' \[Note: manhwa chapter 149.\]

From Shanxi to Henan, from Henan to Anhui, and the year spent at Mount Jiuhua. I remembered every moment we spent together.

Jeok Cheon-Gang had led me out of the Jin Family of Taiyuan, and I followed him into the vast world. We were always together.

'How was it, just as this old man said?'

'What are you talking about?'

'The Ghostly Dance of the Fire God. Wasn’t it spectacular?' \[Note: all three lines are from manhwa chapter 179.\]

His expression, tinged with a gentle smile amidst bouts of coughing blood, remains vivid in my mind.

And under the glow of a full moon, he spoke, masking his sincerity with casual words.

'Master? What Master? Just call me Grandfater.' \[Note: this is from manhwa chapter 132. Although not directly shown in the manhwa, this is probably something from the novel that was skipped.\]

"Grandfather."

I know that even if I call out, he won't answer.

I don't call out because I hope he will hear, but because there are words I wish to say.

"You know what?"

How could I possibly know, you brat!

A chuckle escaped me as I heard his voice on the chilly breeze. I gripped Jeok Cheon-Gang's wrinkled hand tightly and whispered.

"I always wanted to call you Master." \[Note: the MC is technically not the Fire King's disciple. The Fire King is in the MC's debt for taking care of Jo-Pil for him (manhwa chapter 119). So the Fire King is teaching him as a repayment for that debt, and is very adamant that the MC is not his disciple. Fire King, AKA Tsundere King.\]

Somewhere along our journey, it became clear to me.

He had become my Master, and I, his disciple.

In our hearts, we both secretly valued this sacred bond.

"Young Master Jin. The time has come."

Heeding the Divine Doctor's call, I diverted my attention from Jeok Cheon-Gang's face.

With a composed expression, I respectfully performed a bow towards the elderly physician and his young disciple.

"Please take good care of my Master."

Their acknowledgments came through equivalent gestures of commitment.

"I will do my utmost."

"I, too, will do everything in my power to assist Master."

Their assurances were all the solace I needed. Now was the time to trust in their skills and in fate itself.

We have done everything that humans can do, so all that is left is to leave it to the Heaven.

God, Buddha, Allah, or the Jade Emperor.

'Whoever it may be, if you help just this once, I will never forget it.'

Though I do not believe in gods, I do believe there is an omnipotent being above us.

In a moment of silent supplication to this undefined power, the Divine Doctor's grave tone broke through.

"Remember, fifteen days. No one should approach until then."

What if it takes longer than fifteen days?

I repressed the question, choosing instead to place my faith in their capabilities. I vowed to the three of them:

"I will protect him with my life, no matter who may come for us."

\* \* \*

"Is that all?"

The scrutiny in the middle-aged man's gaze was unyielding as it fell upon the figure before him.

Contorted limbs and stripped flesh — the sight was ghastly. The victim's voice was as thin as a whisper.

"Yes, I've told you all I know..."

"Isn't the most crucial part missing?"

"I don't know. I really don't."

Blood-stained tears escaped the solitary eye he had left, and his blood-soaked garments were now also stained with urine.

With a voice shaking from terror, he pleaded.

"Just kill me now, please..."

The middle-aged man, observing the dimming light in the man's eyes, tutted in acknowledgment.

"It seems you're telling the truth."

The man had endured unimaginable torture for half a day.

The man's plea for death, rather than life, underscored his honesty.

Until now, no one had ever lied in front of the middle-aged man.

Except for one person: the Poison King Tang Sa-Mun.

"Your half-day's worth of spirit, I've seen it well. Now, you may rest."

Swish, thud!

With a swift motion, the life of the man, once a diligent operative within the Tang Family's Green Shadow Squad, was claimed by a mere flick, granting him a tranquil demise.

The middle-aged figure observed the lifeless form below, then gestured grandly.

Bang!

A loud noise followed, and a pit one jang deep appeared.

Subsequently, the bodies of five others that were scattered around were stacked neatly in the pit. The task of concealing them beneath the earth was accomplished in mere moments.

"The Green Shadow Squad... they're like flies."

He spoke softly, his gaze piercing through the mountainous terrain towards the west, in the direction of the stronghold of the Tang Family of Sichuan.

'I should have killed Tang Sa-Dok when I first found him.'

That oversight had proven costly. The Poison King's defiance was more robust than anticipated, leading to a prolonged battle to neutralize the poison and resulting in the loss of his arm.

Against lesser factions like the Emei or Qingcheng Sects, such a disadvantage might be inconsequential. However, the fortified and vigilant Tang Family posed a significant challenge. Now, diminished by his injury, a solo assault seemed foolhardy.

'However, it only extends their lifeline by a few more days. The outcome will not change.'

The machinations within Sichuan, encompassing the Emei Sect, Qingcheng Sect, and Tang Family, were already under his surveillance.

The strategy to eliminate the three tigers lurking within Sichuan was set.

It was now time to summon the hunters.

Swoosh!

The middle-aged man moved as if gliding, with each step erasing vast distances.

Finally, his steps halted at a cliff deep within the mountains.

"This is the place."

He approached the cliff and, with a deliberate touch, initiated a remarkable transformation.

Wooong.

With a resonating echo, the cliff crumbled away.

No, it was more accurate to say that space itself twisted. Weathered stones and rocks vanished, revealing an open cavity that had been concealed.

'The sorcery of the Qi Entrance Array is always astonishing to behold.'

Yet, what he was about to undertake dwarfed such feats in comparison.

Crunch, crunch, crunch.

Advancing into the chamber's heart, where arcane symbols were inscribed, he positioned himself at the epicenter, ready to harness his profound energy.

As the eerie, dark crimson haze enveloped him and touched the arcane symbols, he shouted,

"Long live the Heavenly Lord!"

Fwoosh!

With the middle-aged man's cry, the pattern lit up. A black brilliance that was both dark and bright filled the cavern, indescribable in its essence.

Then, as the light receded, the cavern was filled with a resonating declaration.

"We greet the Western Heavenly Demon Lord!"

"We greet the Demon Lord!"

Arrayed before him were hundreds of elite warriors, their presence defined by indifferent gazes and lethal intent, all uniformly garbed in somber black robes.

Observing them, the lips of the middle-aged man, now revealed as the Western Heavenly Demon Lord, curved into a subtle smile, acknowledging the assembly of his formidable tiger hunters.
