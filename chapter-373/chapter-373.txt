The journey back was brief.

On the way there, we had adjusted our speed in order to exchange information, but on the way back, it felt like a race between five Transcendent Masters.

A journey that would have spanned half a day for an ordinary person was now drastically cut shorter.

"Good work, Young Master Jin."

"Thank you for accompanying us even though you must still be tired."

Approaching the Tang Family of Sichuan, I offered a nonchalant response to the two Sect Leaders' gratitude.

"It's nothing. I hardly did anything noteworthy, really."

"Indeed."

"That's true."

"......"

Granted, my role was minimal, but their bluntness stung a bit.

The Sapphire Wind Blade, with a gentle smile, then respectfully addressed the Dark Saint and Jeok Cheon-Gang.

"I also would like to thank the two Sunbaes. I feel somewhat guilty for making you take this unnecessary journey."

The Dark Saint and Jeok Cheon-Gang answered at the same time.

"It was indeed an unnecessary journey."

"Next time, don't do anything you'll feel sorry for. Understood?"

"......Ah, yes."

That doesn't feel good, does it?

The Dark Saint then addressed the Sapphire Wind Blade with gravity.

"Furthermore... I hope you won't look for me in the future."

His plea was no mere formality. Having briefly resumed his Dark Saint persona, he now yearned to return to his quieter life as Mun Kyung, the young doctor.

The significance of his request was lost on none present.

But the two Sect Leaders were taken aback.

"But, Sunbae... That's..."

"Grandmaster. Maybe you should think over it once more?"

Yet, they were met with nothing but the Dark Saint's indifferent stare.

After a pause, both the Sapphire Wind Blade and the Annihilating Shinni exhaled resignedly and agreed.

"......We will do as you wish."

"We will respect the Grandmaster's intentions. For now."

For now. These final words bore a profound significance. The Dark Saint's voice was gentle.

"Stepping back into Murim this time was just a small whim. My intentions remain unchanged."

His declaration was firm, leaving no misunderstanding. His gaze then shifted between me and Jeok Cheon-Gang.

"I trust that you both understand."

Jeok Cheon-Gang broke the silence.

"Will you resume your guise as a medical student?"

"I'm not assuming a guise. The Dark Saint is no more; only the physician remains."

"Even if a tiger wears goat skin, can it truly be called a goat?"

"If it hides its teeth and claws, then a tiger can become a goat."

"But in the end, the claws were revealed, weren't they?"

A trace of annoyance crossed the Dark Saint's face.

"You talk more as you age. You owe me, remember?"

"…Fine. I can't argue with that."

"I'll take that as your answer."

Dismissing the exchange with Jeok Cheon-Gang, the Dark Saint's attention turned to me.

"And you?"

"Me?"

"Who else is left?"

"No, it's not that. Do I have a choice?"

"Of course, there are two options."

The Dark Saint spoke with a blunt expression.

"First, blabber about Mun Kyung, the young doctor, being the Dark Saint and then be found as an unrecognizable corpse. Or second, keep your mouth shut, treat me as before, and depart on peaceful terms."

"…"

"Which will it be?"

His stark ultimatum left me speechless for a moment.

After swallowing hard, I finally spoke.

"The second option."

"Good thinking."

"Cool." \[Note: thus far, the MC has been using a formal tone with Mun Kyung after he found out that he is the Dark Saint, but the MC reverted back to a casual tone with this line.\]

The Dark Saint, on the verge of nodding in affirmation, paused.

"What?"

"Why are you confused?"

"What?"

"What do you mean 'what'? You told me to be comfortable with you like before."

"......!"

"......!"

Both Sect Leaders gaped in astonishment, while the Dark Saint, momentarily caught off guard, let out a chuckle before turning to Jeok Cheon-Gang with a question,

"Is this one out of his mind?"

"That's just how he is. Annoying, isn't it?"

"I'd like to smash his head in."

Before my head could actually be smashed, I quickly bowed in apology.

"Ah, I was momentarily mistaken. My apologies."

"......I wouldn't believe that excuse even if I were a dog, but I'll let it slide this time."

Was my fake apology too obvious? The Dark Saint, eyeing me skeptically, advised,

"Anyway, be careful from now on. Aside from those here, nobody should know the truth about me. Ah, that child, Cheong Pung, is an exception. And of course, my disciple."

"Young Master Cheong knew too?"

"Yes. Except for that child, everyone who saw me that day has died."

The elimination was meticulous. This explains the lack of captives at the Tang Family of Sichuan.

The masked Dark Saint. Once the mask is off, both panel and audience are doomed.

'It's strangely unsettling the more I think about it. Mun Kyung was the Dark Saint all along.'

Recollections of our time together - from the initial encounter by the Yangtze River until now - played in my mind.

Which of his actions were true, and which were false?

The innocent young doctor I once knew is gone. What remains is the world's most formidable assassin, his gaze cold and detached.

Compelled by my thoughts, I voiced a question.

"Why do you insist on hiding yourself?"

Halted in his stride toward the distant Tang Family of Sichuan, my question made him pause.

Following a moment of silence, his reply was unexpectedly serene.

"I'm sick of martial arts."

"So you left?"

"Yes. I swore to the heavens that I would never take another life again."

In Murim, assassins are scorned by both the orthodox and unorthodox sects alike.

Their disdain stems from viewing assassins not as martial artists striving for higher mastery, but merely as entities bred for slaughter.

The title of Dark Saint must have come at the cost of countless lives. I could begin to grasp the weight he carried.

But...

"I'm a bit curious, though."

"What?"

"Why did you return to the world you hate so much?"

"Return? What nonsense are you talking about?"

A shadow passed over the Dark Saint's eyes.

"It was a choice born of necessity, not desire."

"Well, if you say so, but it seems like you've made a few choices on your own. For example..."

Pausing to scratch my head, I elaborated,

"Requesting to travel together with some martial artists you encountered by the Yangtze River, saying you were heading the same way, or coincidentally meeting them again days later and subtly revealing your identity. Or even using my name to instruct the successor of the Beggar Sect to save the Emei Sect while you went to the Qingcheng Sect..."

"Stop."

"Yes. I was planning to stop anyway. Listing them out, it seems there are quite a few."

"What do you want to hear? That I should have stood by and watch as you, your master, and countless others died?"

"Of course not. I'm truly grateful, Grandmaster."

This wasn't sarcasm but a sincere gratitude. If he hadn't stepped in at the right time, countless people would have died or been injured.

Including Jeok Cheon-Gang and myself.

Yet, the Dark Saint's reply was as desolate as a desert.

"Don't call me a Grandmaster."

"Then what should I call you?"

With a silent stare, he averted his gaze.

As he took a step towards the distant Tang Family of Sichuan, his old self slid away like a ghost.

The boy's voice was faint, as if carried away by the breeze.

"Mun Kyung. Call me Mun Kyung."

Is that truly all it takes? The answer lies with him alone.

I responded with a shrug,

"Alright, got it. Mun Kyung."

"......!"

With those words, his next step faltered.

\* \* \*

Upon my return to the pavilion, two leeches clung to me.

One was Hyuk Mu-Jin, who couldn't remember if he was my right hand or my left pinky finger, and the other was a beggar whose complexion seemed a shade lighter, possibly due to a recent wash.

"Why is Mun Kyung like that? He seems a bit gloomier than usual."

"That's natural. The Divine Doctor has been injured, and there are so many patients waiting right now."

"Ah, I see. But Squad Leader, where did you and Mun Kyung go?"

"He must have taken the boy out for some air since he seemed down. Are you stupid?"

"Wow, I can't believe this beggar. Even though I look like this, I have read hundreds of books. No one has ever called me stupid."

From what I see, they both seem quite stupid.

I swallowed the word "Dark Saint" that was at the tip of my tongue. These two would remain clueless about Mun Kyung's actual identity even in a hundred lifetimes.

'Well, with that level of acting, anyone would be deceived.'

As soon as people started paying attention to him, he seamlessly reverted to Mun Kyung.

The slight shift in the usually jovial young doctor's demeanor raised no suspicions.

The truth remained a closely guarded secret.

"If it were the Four Books and Five Classics, I would be impressed, but you've been reading nothing but martial arts novels." \[Note: the Four Books are Chinese classic texts illustrating the core value and belief systems in Confucianism, and the Five Classics are prominent Chinese books that form part of the traditional Confucian canon. These works were believed to be written, edited, or commented by Confucius.\]

"I've read romance novels too. Ever heard of Gui Yeom-Mi?"

"Wait. Gui Yeom-Mi? Are you talking about the author of 'The Temptation of the Later Generations,' 'He Was Strong,' and so on?"

"Oh, you know."

"Of course, I do. I got beaten up by our gang leader for borrowing it with the money I begged for back when I was a disciple. If I met that guy now, I'd just..."

Whack!

"Ouch!"

"Ah!"

After reminiscing over their shared pastime, I ushered the pair out and firmly shut the door behind them.

With all that's been weighing on me, their disturbance was the last thing needed.

'It's finally quiet.'

Cheong Pung was likely elsewhere by now, and Jeok Cheon-Gang had instructed me to rest well today, ensuring a brief respite from any disturbances.

Settling onto the inviting bed, I resolved to tackle a task long overdue.

'Check unread notifications.'

Ding. Ding. Ding, Ding!

There was a persistent chiming as a myriad of System Windows popped into existence. Though this had happened a few times before, this instance seemed to set a new record.

Speechless, I embarked on the task of sifting through each notification.

\- You have reached the realm of \[Transcendence\]!

\- You have defeated \[Lv.170 Hundred-Year-Old General\]! \[Note: the list of notifications seems to be in chronological order, which would mean that this notification is from defeating the Western Heavenly Demon Lord.\]

\- You have successfully completed the quest, \[Uninvited Guest\]!

\- You have gained a massive amount of experience points and fame!

\- System message limit exceeded. Experience points and fame will be consolidated.

\- You have reached \[Lv.120\]!

\- Fame has surpassed the threshold limit! You have gained a new title!

\- You have gained enlightenment amidst life and death battles. All martial arts skills have significantly advanced, enabling the use of new martial arts techniques!

\- \[Scorching Sun Divine Arts\] has achieved eighth mastery! \[Note: this is a notification that he glimpsed briefly after absorbing the Heavenly Force Demon.\]

\- \[Divine Palm of Fire\] has achieved...

\- \[Divine Spear of the Fire Dragon\] has achieved...

An overwhelming flood of updates.

Merely skimming them made my head whirl.

"Whoa, sh..."

What's all this?

The realization that I had yet to explore half of the updates dumbfounded me.

Curiously scrolling further, a particular update drew my attention.

\- A new item has become bound to you.

\- Currently bound items: \[White Flames\], \[???\]

\- The name has not been decided yet. Once you assign a new name, the item will be wholly bound to you and can be summoned from anywhere through your inventory.

"What is this..."

The inventories of the modern world and the martial world are separate. However, bound items like White Flames can be summoned from anywhere, unrestricted by space.

It was disappointing to only be able to carry White Flames with me, so this is good news.

'If you give me that, I'll be grateful.'

Eager, I prepared to delve into my inventory.

Knock, knock, knock.

An interruption at the door, followed by a familiar voice peeking through.

"Squad Leader, it's me, Mu-Jin..."

"Get lost."

"No, listen..."

"I'm busy. Go read some Gui Yeom-Mi romance novel or something."

"Oh, Squad Leader, you've read them too?"

"…Seriously, this bastard."

This won't do. Before I start unboxing the new item, I need to box this bastard first.

As I abruptly sat up from the bed, Hyuk Mu-Jin urgently shouted.

"Henan! It's Henan!"

"What?"

"A delegation has come from Henan! They're looking for you, Squad Leader."

"…A delegation?"

My brows furrowed at Hyuk Mu-Jin's abrupt and clipped information.

Ding.

A familiar notification sound reached my ears.
