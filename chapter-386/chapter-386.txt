"I've arrived too late. Have you all been waiting long?" \[Note: because everyone is using translation magic, Lee Jeong-Ryong is able to speak in Korean and everyone present can understand him.\]

Lee Jeong-Ryong took in the assortment of faces before him, recognizing some, while others were new acquaintances.

Magic Johnson, Fei Chen, the young British prince, and the notorious Chinese mischief-maker, all of whom he'd crossed paths with during the Great Cataclysm, were present.

As Lee Jeong-Ryong's eyes met theirs, the S-rank hunters assembled in the underground bunker were quick to welcome him.

「It's been a while, Lee. You’ve become even more attractive since I last saw you. Every time I see you, I feel like confessing my feelings.」

“Hold it, Magic Johnson. You're not my type. Ms. Fei Chen on the other hand...”

In reaction to Lee Jeong-Ryong's playful banter, Fei Chen elegantly swept her hair aside.

「Oh my, I had no idea Mr. Lee had such feelings for me. It's a shame. I found out too late.」

“What’s there to regret? You’re still in your prime.”

「It’s nice of you to say that, but the younger folks might laugh. They'll ask what these old people are doing.」

“Old? Is that so?”

Wu Hei-Xing hastily dismissed the notion with a gesture as Lee Jeong-Ryong looked his way.

「Ah, no, not at all, Mr. Lee. How could that be?」

“I’ve heard a lot about you. Talented and, hmm, quite honest in everything.”

「Th-thank you.」

Wu Hei-Xing lowered his gaze, showing a rare moment of humility.

Ordinarily quick to scorn Koreans, he now found himself unable to maintain such bravado in Lee Jeong-Ryong's presence.

A solitary sweat droplet traced Wu Hei-Xing's neck.

「I’ve heard the rumors but never really expected you to come.」

“Of course, I should come. Shouldn’t we help our neighbors when they are in trouble?”

「It is an honor to meet Mr. Lee.」

None could stand equal to Lee Jeong-Ryong, not even the illustrious Magic Johnson and Fei Chen, heroes of the Great Cataclysm.

He was the sworn brother to Cheon Tae-Min, who was hailed as the savior of the century and leader of the Ares Guild.

Lee Jeong-Ryong commanded immense respect as the guild's Vice Leader and one of the top three S-rank hunters globally.

Such a stature demanded deference.

Even the likes of Wu Hei-Xing and the royal brat were no exceptions.

“Pleased to meet you. It’s good to see you, Jeong-Ryong Lee.” \[Note: this is Prince Felix speaking in Korean.\]

“Ah, so you’re that prince.”

「How preposterous…….」

Prince Felix, gesturing for his secretary to stop speaking, inclined his head gracefully.

"Just Felix. You can call me Felix."

His formal English, funneled through a translation device to Korean, carried a deliberate simplicity.

Yet, with this, Felix Alexander Louis, third in line for the British throne, clearly distinguished Lee Jeong-Ryong from the others. He even omitted his official title.

Lee Jeong-Ryong remained unfazed by this gesture.

'They're just kids, after all.'

He regarded only Magic Johnson and Fei Chen with any real recognition.

To him, Wu Hei-Xing, despite his public acclaim as a prodigy, and Prince Felix were merely novices embarking on their journey.

And then… there were those who truly bothered Lee Jeong-Ryong.

'The Peace Guild.'

His attention shifted to two figures standing apart, his expression softening into a knowing smile.

"Seems like I see you two quite often these days. Have you both been well?"

At his words, Jin Tae-Kyung and Choi Min-Woo exchanged looks, responding with a mix of indifference and affirmation.

"Not really."

"Very."

"……?"

What's this?

Lee Jeong-Ryong found himself momentarily at a loss.

Their demeanor had notably shifted since their last meeting barely a month prior.

'Hostility.'

That was it. The clear hostility and wariness that he had felt from them before was gone.

Observing their serene confidence, Lee Jeong-Ryong pinpointed the cause.

'They've become stronger. Incomparably stronger than before.'

The aura surrounding Choi Min-Woo was notably more potent and refined, sparking curiosity about their rapid advancement.

And as for Jin Tae-Kyung...

'...what...'

The intense vitality coursing through him was palpable, a testament to his profound energy and the depth of his resolve.

This realization hit Lee Jeong-Ryong with the force of revelation.

'He has surpassed the wall.'

The discovery sent a jolt through him, compelling him to conceal his surprise.

'How could this happen?'

Previously, Jin Tae-Kyung was recognized as a formidable competitor, arguably surpassing many global A-rank hunters.

His solo defeats of two Named Monsters naturally stirred public and media speculation about the rise of a new S-rank hunter.

However, Lee Jeong-Ryong was aware that Jin Tae-Kyung had not yet surmounted 'the wall' and anticipated a considerable journey before he could truly ascend to greatness.

And yet...

'Such an impossible thing has happened.'

The shock Lee Jeong-Ryong experienced was more profound than mere surprise. Facing Jin Tae-Kyung's serene look, he felt an emotion he had long since forgotten.

Anxiety. Nervousness.

This sense of unease was novel since his ascendancy within the Ares Guild.

Merely months prior, Jin Tae-Kyung was only a source of irritation. Now, he evoked a genuine sense of unease in Lee Jeong-Ryong.

'This guy...'

The smile previously gracing Lee Jeong-Ryong's face faded, replaced by concern. Wei Feng-Hu cast a puzzled glance his way.

「Mr. Lee? Is there a problem?」

"…It's nothing."

「Hmm. Then, shall we start the meeting?」

Lee Jeong-Ryong, nodding without a word, kept his focus on a single figure.

Jin Tae-Kyung, reclining with ease, spoke softly as though to himself.

"Well, it doesn't seem like nothing."

"……!"

"Well anyway..."

Lee Jeong-Ryong found himself unconsciously gripping his fist tightly.

\* \* \*

The strategy session in the underground command center stretched on.

The topic was the recent monster onslaught that had claimed hundreds of thousands of lives within the last week, marking it as both a colossal natural catastrophe and a dire emergency.

「So, dividing our forces into the Five Armies to pressure the enemies is...」

Wei Feng-Hu was interrupted mid-sentence, his face a mask of seriousness.

「Minister of National Defense, sir.」

「Speak, General Liao.」

General Liao, his uniform adorned with numerous medals, stroked his beard thoughtfully before beginning.

「Listening to our Minister of National Defense is just too frustrating. How long until we get to deal with those monsters?」

Wow...

His manner of speech is notably bold. It's surprising he'd address Wei Feng-Hu like this, given Feng-Hu's status as the President's confidant and the top military authority.

Sensing my confusion, Mr. Choi explained via Message Magic:

\- The Communist Party has its factions too. General Liao's family are blue-bloods of the Princelings, the Communist Party's most powerful faction, and is in a competitive relationship with the Shanghai Clique, to which President Shao and Minister of National Defense Wei Feng-Hu belong. \[Note: the Princelings are descendants of the revolutionary veterans and Chinese Communist Party elites who leverage their lineage for influence and promote business-friendly policies. The Shanghai Clique are officials who rose under Jiang Zemin, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China from 1989 to 2002, and focus on economic reforms and professional achievements.\]

\- Princes and Shangs, what?

\- …If we really have to rank them, the Princelings would be number one, and the Shanghai Clique would be number two.

\- Oh.

My understanding was that the Communist Party functioned as a unified entity, yet it appears internal conflicts and power struggles are rampant.

\- But is that really okay? If President Shao just points his finger and says, 'This guy is harmful,' wouldn't he be beheaded in Tiananmen Square?

\- They do it because they can.

\- …Well, I have nothing to say if you put it that way.

\- It's a compromise between the factions. The president from the Princelings made so many mistakes during the Great Cataclysm that it was awkward to continue holding power.

\- Ah, Pingping?

\- Yes. Pingping.

That damn Great Cataclysm really changed a lot of things.

While I was receiving this explanation from Mr. Choi, General Liao, born into the blue-blood youth of the Princelings, made an outrageous suggestion.

「Let's use nuclear weapons.」

「……?」

「……?」

「I will formally request President Shao, and we'll launch dozens of nuclear warheads across Sichuan. Wouldn't that cleanly solve everything?」

「…….」

「…….」

Have you ever seen such a crazy nuclear bastard?

The room shared a collective disbelief.

Minister of National Defense Wei Feng-Hu's reaction was particularly telling. He responded as if he was itching to draw a pistol.

「Rejected.」

「Why! Are you ignoring me just because I'm not from the Shanghai Clique!」

「Say something that makes sense. Make some sense! What about the people who are still alive or haven't been harmed! What about the devastation of our lands!」

「The sacrifice of cows for the greater good is inevitable!」

I don't know about the others, but he sounds like a real bullhead.

Magic Johnson, who had been silently observing, suddenly interjected with a resonant tone.

「Aside from the damage a nuclear attack could cause, what if they teleport the warheads using spatial magic? To, say, Beijing or somewhere?」

「That’s where you, as a Grand Mage, come in...」

「Me? The opponent isn't just any Lich. If an Arch Lich proves to be more skilled in magic than me, then we're facing a disaster that can't be undone. Haven't we seen similar incidents at the start of the Great Cataclysm?」

「But still... such sacrifices are...」

「Hey. Motherfucker.」

Bang!

Magic Johnson rose abruptly, his muscles gleaming.

「Stop it. Or my attraction to Asian men might compel me to intervene personally.」 \[Note: I don't know what's being cooked here, but I can't smell what the author is cooking.\]

「...!」

「...!」

That’s the scariest threat I've heard so far.

General Liao's complexion drained as he scanned the room for support, only to find his colleagues conspicuously avoiding eye contact.

‘So, it’s resolved just like that.’

The opponent is America's national hero and gay icon.

It seemed everyone was desperately trying not to become the type of Asian man Magic Johnson prefers. \[Note: oh I see. The smell is getting stronger. I think I know what the author is cooking.\]

Of course, General Liao’s bullshit also played a big part in this.

「Enough, both of you. Especially you, General Liao, stop talking nonsense.」

Guided by Wei Feng-Hu, the meeting advanced efficiently.

After amalgamating various viewpoints and thorough discussion, a weary Wei Feng-Hu reached a consensus.

「We will deploy the six S-rank hunters present here across six different fronts. According to the formal organization, three divisions each from the army and air force, along with hunters from the Public Security Force, will be dispatched.」

The Chinese army divisions and the Public Security Force.

Though I don’t know the exact numbers, the sheer volume alone will be tremendous.

China always competes for first or second place in terms of the number of hunters they possess.

‘Of course, the opposition is no less formidable.’

With casualties already in the hundreds of thousands and the possibility of the Arch Lich raising an undead army...

The magnitude of the threat looms large.

「With this, the meeting is concluded. Please proceed to your assignments without delay.」

As attendees began to stand, following Wei Feng-Hu's directive to provide detailed assignments in writing, an unexpected request was made.

\- Look at me for a moment.

Someone's voice penetrated my ears. It was definitely not Message Magic, but a Sound Transmission.
