Plod, plod.

Steady, unwavering steps echoed through the corridors, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's stride devoid of any rush or pause.

Amidst the cascade of crumbling stones from the ceiling and the engulfing darkness, his composure remained intact.

After all, the Four Great Demon Lords were powerful beings.

Though all the power in the world could not rid the Western Heavenly Demon Lord of one fear: failing to fulfill the esteemed decree of the Heavenly Lord.

"To think I was detained by that child, Jin Tae-Kyung, for so long."

The delay had been unforeseen.

Reminded of Jin Tae-Kyung, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord subconsciously touched his forehead.

There was only a nagging ache and pronounced swelling. Yet this injury was more bothersome than his lacerated hands and bleeding shoulder.

'How?'

Jin Tae-Kyung was hanging by his neck while his limbs were shattered.

His Qi was depleted, and with injuries that severe, a normal Peak Master would have died long ago...

'To think I couldn't fully block it even with protective Qi.'

The Western Heavenly Demon Lord let out a derisive snort.

Jin Tae-Kyung had penetrated his protective Qi with a mere headbutt and inflicted injury upon him. It defied all logic.

To the Western Heavenly Demon Lord, Jin Tae-Kyung epitomized utter desperation and determination.

'Isn't this truly supernatural strength?'

It was as intriguing as it was unsettling.

Although Cheong Pung, in the Transcendent Realm, outmatched Jin Tae-Kyung in martial prowess, the threat Jin Tae-Kyung posed stemmed from a different quality.

'His strength resides in his very nature.'

His martial capability was extraordinary for a Peak Master, and he seemed to be fueled by an inconceivable resolve.

Had Jin Tae-Kyung not been on the brink of exhaustion, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord would not have hesitated to strangle him.

But now, everything was smoothly coming to an end.

"Is this the place?"

The Western Heavenly Demon Lord's footsteps halted in front of a firmly shut iron door. While most of the prison cells were made of bars, the treatment room's massive iron door stood out conspicuously.

Of course, no barrier could withstand the Western Heavenly Demon Lord.

'Let's see what's inside.'

Without a moment's delay, he unleashed a Qi-laden strike upon the iron door.

It sliced through both the door and its lock effortlessly.

Clang, boom!

The iron door, now bisected, crashed to the ground with resounding force.

Striding confidently into the treatment room, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord spotted a figure and offered a slight smile.

"Are you the Divine Doctor?"

Beside a cold stone bed, an elderly man seated in a chair slowly opened his eyes.

His voice, serene and composed, filled the space.

"It's just a vain title given by the people of this world."

"I've heard rumors about you. I wanted to meet you because I heard that no one knows your name, age, or even if you're a man or a woman."

"So, what do you think now that you see me?"

"You're as I thought. You seem more like a real immortal than those Taoist monks who pretend to be noble and high above the rest of us."

The Divine Doctor let out a weary sigh.

"I wish that were true. If I were an immortal, I'd have the power to drive away demons."

"Do I look like a demon to you?"

The Western Heavenly Demon Lord held his arms wide open while he spun around.

Beneath the tattered and bloodstained clothes, his appearance was remarkably ordinary, akin to any middle-aged man.

"The Heavenly Lord descended from heaven to earth, and under His almighty power are four loyal servants."

His tone was mild, yet firm.

"I am neither a demon nor an immortal. I'm just one servant following His commands."

"…!"

The Divine Doctor's eyes fluttered with a mix of disbelief and apprehension.

Heavenly Lord? A servant? The man's delusion was evident, yet his conviction was unnerving.

"Nonsense! If you, who kills without hesitation, are not a demon, then what are you?"

"It's a shame. But what can I do? Erasing those who oppose His will is also my duty."

"Who exactly are you…?"

Overwhelmed, the Divine Doctor faltered, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's sigh resonating softly.

The air grew thick with the pungent scent of blood emanating from his every word and gesture.

"Get out."

"Hm? What did you say?"

"I said get out. No one is allowed in during treatment, especially not a demon like you."

The Western Heavenly Demon Lord met the Divine Doctor's grave gaze with a burst of laughter.

"I thought you were a stubborn doctor, but you do have a sense of humor. Look here, Divine Doctor. The treatment has already ended."

"It hasn't ended."

With a grin, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord advanced, his path leading him to Jeok Cheon-Gang, who appeared lifeless.

"Well, in my opinion, it seems we need to move the patient elsewhere."

"Before that... you need the doctor's permission."

As the Divine Doctor rose, his expression stern,

Pop, pop, pop!

An array of light beams erupted from his voluminous sleeves. A myriad of needles, varying in size, darted towards their target, tracing both straight and curved trajectories aimed at the neck's vital areas.

Yet, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's laughter intensified at the spectacle.

"How amusing."

Thud, thud, thud!

Effortlessly, the powerful protective Qi surrounding him repelled the assault.

The needles quivered, halted by the Qi barrier.

"And it's a pity."

Crunch.

The Western Heavenly Demon Lord clenched and then opened his palm. An invisible force of energy, following the will of its master, snatched and crushed the needles.

Despite the Divine Doctor's martial prowess, he was outmatched by the Western Heavenly Demon Lord, the chasm between them immense.

"Let me reiterate. The treatment has ended."

"......!"

As the Western Heavenly Demon Lord spoke in a soft voice, the Divine Doctor's body floated into the air.

Psychokinesis, a feat only a possessor of a tremendous amount of Qi could perform.

The Divine Doctor's complexion turned pale as he was flung into the hands of the Western Heavenly Demon Lord. He struggled to speak with the hand encircling his throat.

"Evil... demon."

"For a doctor who has no hesitation in using lethal force, that doesn't seem like something you should say. Now, wouldn't you also be considered a demon?"

"When I think...of the blood...that stains your hands...I will gladly become a demon!"

Shick, thud.

The Divine Doctor's defiant cry and subsequent sword lunge were effortlessly thwarted.

The Western Heavenly Demon Lord, with a flicker of intrigue in his eyes, snapped the elderly doctor's wrist.

"The Patriarch was right. You do have it."

The Western Heavenly Demon Lord's attention shifted to the Divine Doctor's hand.

On his wrinkled fingers was an object that did not at all suit a doctor.

"So, this is the Ring of All Poisons..."

A ring emanating a faint luminescence, its gem capturing the both light and darkness.

Captivated, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord delicately extricated the Ring of All Poisons from the Divine Doctor's grasp, adorning it upon his own finger.

"The Heavenly Lord will be pleased."

Having witnessed the entire scene, the Divine Doctor emitted a stifled moan.

"W-what exactly are you planning to do?"

"Don't be curious. After all, your role ends here."

Shick, thud!

A force, as sharp as a blade, pierced through the Divine Doctor's abdomen.

As his dantian shattered, the Divine Doctor vomited blood and was flung far away.

"Kuweeeek!"

"It seems we no longer need the doctor's permission, do we?"

Amidst his anguish, the Divine Doctor witnessed the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's mirthful demeanor.

The quest was complete. With the Ring of All Poisons now secured and the dominant forces of Sichuan vanquished, no obstacles remained.

There was nothing left to stand in his way. The time had come to conclude everything and return.

"Come now, let's go together. There's someone who wants to see you."

The Western Heavenly Demon Lord whispered towards Jeok Cheon-Gang, who lay peacefully asleep on a cold stone bed, as he attempted to pull the Fire King's body towards him using Psychokinesis.

But it was at that moment.

Woooong.

"......!"

An ominous hum filled the air.

Or rather, the Western Heavenly Demon Lord recognized it as powerful vibrations which were gradually approaching.

'Could it be that the collapse has already begun?'

He cast his gaze towards the disturbance's origin.

Beyond the demolished entry, a dim radiance pierced the encompassing gloom.

"What is that......"

His frown deepened, and his eyes abruptly widened.

Woooong, gugugugung!

The hum escalated, ushering in a tempestuous wind.

And then.

Boom!

A blinding light shot through the treatment room.

No, it was a spear enveloped in blue flames.

The name of a certain individual flashed in his mind, prompting the Western Heavenly Demon Lord to erupt in laughter.

"Haha! You are truly supernatural!"

His laughter boomed as a profound darkness surged from his body.

White Flames, wrapped in an azure blaze, collided with the darkness.

Boom!

Amidst the resounding echo that shook the underground prison, a voice rang out.

"Only family and disciples can enter a hospital room, you fucking bastard."

\* \* \*

Step by step.

I advanced through the settling dust.

Neither the ceaseless shower of debris from above nor the engulfing shadow hindered my progress.

I remained fixated on the figure awaiting me.

'Such a monster, but after all I didn't expect him to die so easily from that throw.'

Though unseen, I sensed the potent aura encasing the Western Heavenly Demon Lord.

But I was not as afraid as before.

Silently, I clenched my fist, feeling a surge of power coursing through me.

'Heavenly Force Demon.'

The clash between me and the Western Heavenly Demon Lord presented a new opportunity for him.

The collapsing ceiling broke his shackles, and the old Demon Head was able to leave the prison for the first time in decades.

And the first words the Heavenly Force Demon said to me were completely unexpected.

'All the other prisoners have been killed.'

'Cough. So?'

'Why did you spare me?'

'Does that bother you?'

'Just answer the question. I could end your life right this moment.'

'Just wait a moment longer. It'll end on its own.'

'Bastard!'

It was a conversation between cripples.

One with crushed limbs, the other with severed meridians.

Yet, the Heavenly Force Demon held an edge over me — his Qi was not exhausted.

My life was ebbing away, the shadow of demise looming over me.

I yearned for one final dialogue with the observer of my fading existence.

'I didn't want to kill you.'

'Why not?'

'Because, the you I know wasn't a Demon Head.'

'......!'

'I think it's better to be a 'good guy' from the Demonic Cult than a 'bad guy' from the orthodox factions. Killing someone like you would make me feel like I was no different from a Demon Head.'

In fact, I hesitated a lot. Killing the Heavenly Force Demon could have given me a huge amount of experience points and several levels up.

After much contemplation, I abstained.

Looking back, it was probably for the best. The Western Heavenly Demon Lord wasn't someone I could defeat with just a level or two increase.

To meet death as a free soul rather than with resentment was a more palatable end.

'Well... this isn't too bad.'

The Heavenly Force Demon observed me with a complex expression before extending an offer.

'An offer I couldn't refuse.'

I recalled the Heavenly Force Demon's last words as I waved my hand.

The sudden gust of wind dispersed the dust clouds, revealing his figure.

"Your big brother has arrived." \[Note: the raw uses the word "hyung" but "big brother" seems more fitting in this particular sentence.\]

"Ha! Hahaha!"

Laughter erupted from the Western Heavenly Demon Lord, his figure shaking with mirth.

The vanished door to the treatment chamber revealed another person, wavering on their feet.

The Divine Doctor. His pale face nodded, indicating that Jeok Cheon-Gang was safe.

'Thank god. I'm not too late.'

A deep exhale escaped me as the Western Heavenly Demon Lord, his laughter subsided, raised his gaze.

"You have changed so much that it is difficult to recognize you."

"I received a gift. From someone I never expected."

"A gift?"

"Yes. I received energy."

An exclamation escaped the Western Heavenly Demon Lord.

"Transference of Power between Bodies!" \[Note: direct translation Energy Transmission between Bodies.\]

"Well, that's one way to call it."

"Did you use that technique you talked about? Similar to the Great Qi Absorption Method?"

"No."

"You stumbled upon something great at the most opportune moment, haha!"

"I didn't stumble upon anything. I was asked for a favor."

"A favor?"

"Yes."

I affirmed softly, my mind echoing the Heavenly Force Demon's last words as he imparted his strength to me.

'The Western Heavenly Demon Lord...'

"He asked me to kill you."

Thud, thud, thud. Grasp.

I reached out my hand. White Flames, deeply embedded in the wall, shot forth into my hand.

The Fire Dragon, charged with the might of three gapja, unfurled its wings.

"You're... dead."

A broad grin spread across the Western Heavenly Demon Lord's face.
